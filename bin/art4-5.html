									<div class="para"><span class="label">4.1.</span> The provisions of this article apply not only to the publication of names, but also to the publication of any nomenclatural act (e.g., a proposal to conserve a name).</div>
								</div>
								<div id="art4.2" class="rule">
									<div class="para"><span class="label">4.2.</span> Publication, under this code, is defined as distribution of text (but not sound), with or without images.  To qualify as published, works must be peer-reviewed, consist of numerous (at least 50 copies), simultaneously obtainable, identical, durable, and unalterable copies, some of which are distributed to major institutional libraries (in at least five countries on three continents) so that the work is generally accessible as a permanent public record to the scientific community, be it through sale or exchange or gift, and subject to the restrictions and qualifications in the present article.</div>
									<div id="note4.2.1" class="note">
										<div class="para"><span class="label">Note 4.2.1.</span> If an entire book is not peer-reviewed or a periodical is not consistently peer-reviewed, the article or chapter in which a name or nomenclatural act appears must be peer-reviewed in order to qualify as published.</div>
									</div>
									<div id="note4.2.2" class="note">
										<div class="para"><span class="label">Note 4.2.2.</span> Approval of a work by a thesis or dissertation committee does not constitute peer review.</div>

								<div id="art4.3" class="rule">
									<div class="para"><span class="label">4.3.</span> The following do not qualify as publication: (a) dissemination of text or images solely through electronic communication networks (such as the Internet) or through storage media (such as CDs, diskettes, film, microfilm and microfiche) that require a special device to read; (b) theses and dissertations; (c) abstracts of articles, papers, posters, texts of lectures, and similar material presented at meetings, symposia, colloquia or congresses, even if the abstract is published in a peer-reviewed journal; (d) the placing of texts or images in collections or exhibits, for example, on labels (including specimen labels, even if printed) or information sheets; (e) the reproduction of hand-written material in facsimile, for example, by photocopy; (f) patents and patent applications; (g) newspapers and periodicals intended mainly for people who are not professional biologists, abstracting journals, trade catalogues, and seed exchange lists; (h) anonymous works.

									<div id="note4.3.1" class="note">
										<div class="para"><span class="label">Note 4.3.1.</span> If a name is disseminated through electronic publication (see <a href="#art4.3">Art. 4.3a</a>), it must also satisfy the requirements in <a href="#art4.2">Art. 4.2</a>.</div>

More specifically, it is the date on which the publisher or publisher's agent delivered the printed matter to a carrier for distribution to the public.  In the absence of proof establishing some other date, the one appearing in the publication itself must be accepted as correct.</div>
