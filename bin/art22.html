										The International Society for Phylogenetic Nomenclature (ISPN) is an international, non-profit organization with no membership restrictions.  Two committees of the ISPN have responsibilities that pertain to this code: the Committee on Phylogenetic Nomenclature (CPN) and the Registration Committee.
									</div>
								</div>
								<div id="art22.2">
									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">22.2.</span>
										The Registration Committee is responsible for managing the registration database for phylogenetically defined names.  It has the authority to set policy concerning the routine operation of the database, so long as such decisions do not conflict with the provisions of this code.  The members of the Registration Committee will be appointed by the ISPN through a vote of the Council.
									</div>
								</div>
								<div id="art22.3">

										The CPN has the responsibility and power to:
										<span class="list">
											<span class="list-item">(a) ratify the first edition of this code prior to its implementation;</span>
											<span class="list-item">(b) rule on applications for suppression or conservation of names;</span>
											<span class="list-item">(c) resolve ambiguities in the provisions of this code;</span>
											<span class="list-item">(d) amend the provisions of this code; and</span>

								<div id="art22.4">
									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">22.4.</span>
										The members of the CPN will be elected by the membership of the ISPN.  The number of members in the CPN will be determined by the ISPN.  The CPN officers (Chair and Secretary) will be elected by the membership of the CPN.
									</div>
								</div>
								<div id="art22.5">
									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">22.5.</span>
										Members of the CPN will be elected for three-year terms.  Members may be elected for up to three consecutive terms.  Each officer will be elected for a one-year term in that office (as part of the three-year term as a member).  Officers may serve for up to three consecutive one-year terms and shall not be eligible to serve again in the same office until one year has elapsed since completing the third consecutive term.

								<div id="art22.6">
									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">22.6.</span>
										Applications for suppression or conservation of names, restricted emendations of definitions, and rulings on whether a proposed emendation is restricted or unrestricted must be submitted to the CPN.  Once received, they will be published (<a href="./art4-5.html#art4">Art. 4</a>) and made available on a web site administered by the ISPN.

										Decisions by the CPN on applications for suppression or conservation of names and emendation of definitions must be approved by a two-thirds vote of the CPN. Decisions will be published and announced on a web site administered by the ISPN, and the affected names will be annotated in the registration database.

									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">22.8.</span>
										Decisions by the CPN regarding interpretation of rules (in case of ambiguity) and the status of proposed emendations as restricted or unrestricted require approval by a simple majority of the CPN.  Decisions will be published and announced on a web site administered by the ISPN.

								<div id="art22.9">
									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">22.9.</span>

								<div id="art22.10">
									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">22.10.</span>
										Proposed modifications of this code may not be voted upon until at least six months have elapsed from the date of their publication, to allow for discussion by the systematics community and communication of opinions to the members of the CPN.

								<div id="art22.11">
									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">22.11.</span>
