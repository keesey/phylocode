												<li>A branch-based definition may take the form &quot;the clade consisting of A and all organisms or species that share a more recent common ancestor with A than with Z&quot; (or Y or X, etc., as needed) or &quot;the most inclusive clade containing A but not Z&quot; (or Y or X, etc.).

If this kind of definition is used and &quot;extant&quot; is intended to mean anything other than extant on the publication date of the definition, the author should specify the meaning of &quot;extant&quot; in the first wording or of &quot;crown clade&quot; in the second wording (within the restrictions described in <a href="#art9.4">Art. 9.4</a>)&mdash;e.g., the internal specifiers were extant (and thus the clade was a crown clade) at a particular time in human history.</li>

											</ul>
											The last two definition types are designed to tie names to crown clades (i.e., a clade originating with the most recent common ancestor of two or more extant species or organisms).  These and standard node-based definitions that use extant specifiers may be termed crown clade definitions.

										<div class="para"><span class="label">Note 9.3.2.</span> The application of a phylogenetic definition, and thus also of a phylogenetically defined clade name, requires a hypothesized phylogeny. To accommodate phenomena such as speciation via hybridization, species fusion, and symbiogenesis (see <a href="art1-3.html#note2.1.3">Note 2.1.3</a>), the hypothesized phylogeny that serves as the context for the application of a phylogenetically defined name need not be strictly diverging.</div>

										<div class="para"><span class="label">Recommendation 9.3B.</span> Because poorly chosen wordings of phylogenetic definitions can lead to undesirable consequences (i.e., the application of the name in a way that contradicts the author's intent), the wordings provided in <a href="#note9.3.1">Note 9.3.1</a> should generally be used for the corresponding kinds of definitions. If an alternative wording is used, it should be accompanied by the standard abbreviation (as provided in <a href="#note9.3.1">Note 9.3.1</a>) to clarify the intent of the author in case the alternative wording is ambiguous or confusing. If the definition in words and its abbreviated form appear to be in conflict, the latter should be weighted most heavily in interpreting the author's intent. This recommendation does not preclude the use of other kinds of definitions that are not addressed in <a href="#note9.3.1">Note 9.3.1</a>.</div>

										<div class="para"><span class="label">Note 9.8.2.</span> Demonstrating &quot;prior application of the name to a taxon approximating the clade for which it is being established&quot; does not necessarily require a modern phylogenetic analysis, and it does not require that the author of the prior application conceptualized the taxon as a clade. Application of a name in an earlier publication to a taxon approximating the clade for which it is being converted can be demonstrated based on information in that work&mdash;e.g., a list of subordinate taxa that are broadly consistent with, though not necessarily identical to, the composition of that clade, a description including diagnostic characters that we now understand to be synapomorphies of that clade, or statements and diagrams about phylogenetic relationships. When composition is used to assess the prior application of a name, the historical inclusion of taxa that are no longer considered to belong to the clade in question, or the historical exclusion of taxa that are now considered to belong to this clade, does not necessarily disqualify it as a preexisting name for the clade, provided that its application to that clade approximates traditional use to the degree that it is consistent with the contemporary concept of monophyly.</div>

The name <span class="clade-name">Lamianae</span> was first used by Takhtajan (1967), who applied it to a taxon that included <span class="clade-name">Gentianales</span>, <span class="clade-name">Solanales</span>, <span class="clade-name">Lamiales</span>, and <span class="clade-name">Boraginaceae</span> (though in some cases under different names) as well as some smaller taxa (e.g., <span class="clade-name">Dipsacales</span>, <span class="clade-name">Polemoniaceae</span>) that render his <span class="clade-name">Lamianae</span> polyphyletic in the context of currently accepted phylogenies.  Takhtajan's inclusion of these taxa that are now considered to lie well outside the clade in question, and his omission of <span class="clade-name">Vahliaceae</span>, which is now thought to be part of that clade, do not disqualify <span class="clade-name">Lamianae</span> as a preexisting name for that clade.</div>

Crantz's (1769) <span class="ranked-name">Angiospermae</span> is considered a homonym even though it was used to refer to a subset of the taxon that Lindley named <span class="ranked-name">Angiospermae</span>.
