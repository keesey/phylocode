		<meta name="abstract" content="The PhyloCode is a formal set of rules governing phylogenetic nomenclature. It is designed to name the parts of the tree of life by explicit reference to phylogeny. The PhyloCode will go into operation in a few years, but the exact date has not yet been determined. It is designed so that it may be used concurrently with the existing codes based on rank-based nomenclature (ICBN, ICZN, etc.).

					<div class="para">The <span class="title">PhyloCode</span> grew out of a workshop at Harvard University in August 1998, where decisions were made about its scope and content. Many of the workshop participants, together with several other people who subsequently joined the project, served as an advisory group (see the <span class="title">PhyloCode</span> <a href="./preface.html">preface</a> for a list of the people involved). In April 2000, a <a href="./documents.html#version1">draft</a> was made public on this web site and comments were solicited from the scientific community. All comments were forwarded to the advisory group, and many of them elicited discussion. A second workshop was held at Yale University in July 2002, at which the discussion focused on the governance of species names and the publication of a book of phylogenetically defined clade names as a companion to the <span class="title">PhyloCode</span> (see the <a href="./preface.html#preface-history">History section of the Preface</a>).</div>
					<div class="para">The First International Phylogenetic Nomenclature Meeting, which took place July 6&ndash;9, 2004 in Paris, was attended by about 70 systematic and evolutionary biologists from 11 nations. The program can be downloaded from the <a href="./events.html#ipnm2004">&quot;Events&quot; page</a>. This was the first open, multi-day conference that focused entirely on phylogenetic nomenclature, and it provided the venue for the inauguration of the <a href="http://phylonames.org/">International Society for Phylogenetic Nomenclature</a> (ISPN). The ISPN membership elects the Committee on Phylogenetic Nomenclature (CPN), the responsibilities of which are explained in <a href="art22.html">Art. 22</a> of the <span class="title">PhyloCode</span>. The CPN has taken over the role of the advisory group that oversaw the earlier stages of development of the <span class="title">PhyloCode</span>.</div>
					<div class="para">The Third International Phylogenetic Nomenclature Meeting was held July 21&ndash;23, 2008 at Dalhousie University, Halifax. More information can be downloaded from the <a href="./events.html#ipnm2008">&quot;Events&quot; page</a>.</div>

						<span class="header">Changes in Version 4.</span>
						The current version of the <span class="title">PhyloCode</span> (version 4c), which was posted in January 2010, differs from version 4b in many minor ways, which are detailed in the <a href="./preface.html">Preface</a>.
            In contrast, version 4b (posted in September 2007) differs in major ways from version 3.
            See the <a href="./preface.html#preface-changes">&quot;Changes in Version 4&quot;</a> section of the Preface for details.
