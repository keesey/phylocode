									Selection of Clade Names for Establishment
								</div>
								<div id="art10.1" class="rule">
									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">10.1.</span>
										Clade names are generally to be selected in such a way as to minimize disruption of current and/or historical usage (with regard to composition, diagnostic characters, or both) and to maximize continuity with existing literature.  Therefore, except under the conditions described in <a href="#art10.2">Art. 10.2</a>, a preexisting name that has been applied to a taxon approximating the clade to be named (see <a href="art9.html#note9.8.2">Note 9.8.2</a>), or to a paraphyletic group originating with the same ancestor, must be selected.  If there is a preexisting name for a paraphyletic group originating with the same ancestor as a particular clade and that name is much better known than any preexisting name for that clade, or if there is no preexisting name for that clade, the name of the paraphyletic group may be (but need not be) chosen.
									</div>
									<div id="note10.1.1" class="note">
										<div class="para">
											<span class="label">Note 10.1.1.</span>
											<a href="#art10.1">Art. 10.1</a> and <a href="#rec10.1a">Rec. 10.1A</a> are not intended either to encourage or to discourage the application of preexisting names to crown, apomorphy-based or total clades.  Because the associations of preexisting names with precisely identified clades commonly are ambiguous, reasonable arguments can often be made for applying a particular name to any one of several nested clades between crown and total (inclusive).
										</div>
									</div>
									<div id="rec10.1a" class="recommendation">
										<div class="para">
											<span class="label">Recommendation 10.1A.</span>
											If more than one preexisting name has been applied to a particular clade (including those applied to paraphyletic groups originating with the same ancestor), the name that is most widely and consistently used for it should generally be chosen, though a less widely used name may be chosen if it is a panclade name (see <a href="#note10.3.1">Note 10.3.1</a>).  Similarly, if a preexisting name has been applied to more than one clade, it should generally be established for the clade to which it has been most widely and consistently applied (but see <a href="#note10.1.1">Note 10.1.1</a>).  If the most widely and consistently used name is not selected for conversion, a rationale should be provided.
										</div>
										<div id="note10.1a.1" class="note">
											<div class="para">
												<span class="label">Note 10.1A.1.</span>
												In selecting &quot;the name that is most widely and consistently used,&quot; considerable discretion is left to the converting author.  It is not necessary to choose a name that is slightly more widely used than its closest competitor.  As a general guideline, if there is less than a twofold difference in the frequency of use of two or more names, the converting author may choose any of them without providing a compelling justification.

									<div id="rec10.1b" class="recommendation">
										<div class="para">
											<span class="label">Recommendation 10.1B.</span>
											The name that is more commonly used than any other name to refer to (e.g., discuss or describe) a particular crown clade should generally be defined as applying to that crown clade, even if the name is commonly considered to apply to a clade that includes extinct taxa outside of the crown.  If there is a conflict between Recs. <a href="#rec10.1a">10.1A</a> and <a href="#rec10.1b">10.1B</a>, <a href="#rec10.1b">Rec. 10.1B</a> should be given precedence.  If the name that is more commonly used than any other name to refer to a crown clade is instead defined as applying to a more inclusive clade (e.g., an apomorphy-based or total clade) that contains that crown, a justification should be provided.
										</div>
										<div id="note10.1b.1" class="note">
											<div class="para">
												<span class="label">Note 10.1B.1.</span>
												In older works and in works dealing only with extant organisms, names have sometimes been used as if they apply to particular crown clades, though it is unclear whether the author considered the name to apply to the crown or to a more inclusive clade (i.e., including some or all of the stem).  In such cases, the name may be interpreted as applying to the crown for the purpose of this recommendation.
											</div>
											<div id="note10.1b.1-example1" class="example">
												<div class="para">
													<span class="label">Example 1.</span>
													If a publication stated that all members of clade X (e.g., <span class="clade-name">Mammalia</span>) exhibit a particular feature M (e.g., lactation), and this feature has only been observed in extant species, the name X would have been used in that publication as if it applied to the crown clade.  Given this situation, name X could be interpreted as a candidate name for the crown.

											This format for the definitions of panclade names differs from the other recommended definition formats (see <a href="art9.html#note9.3.1">Note 9.3.1</a>) in not listing any specifiers, which are implicit.  The internal specifiers of the panclade name are those of the crown clade name on which the panclade name is based.  The external specifiers of the panclade name are all extant species or organisms that are not members of the crown clade on whose name the panclade name is based.

											Extinction of crown clades after establishment of a panclade name does not affect the composition of the clade to which the panclade name refers.  A crown clade that is extant at the time of establishment of a panclade name is forever treated nomenclaturally as though it were still extant.  This treatment applies both to the crown clade that provides the base name for the panclade name and to other crown clades whose members are implicit external specifiers (see <a href="#note10.5.2">Note 10.5.2</a>).

										In rank-based nomenclature, there are many examples of identically spelled names being applied to different taxa under different codes (cross-code homonyms).  Only one member of each set of cross-code homonyms is, after conversion, an acceptable name under this code (<a href="art13.html#art13.3">Art. 13.3</a>).  If the preexisting name that has been most widely used for a particular clade cannot be converted because an identically spelled name has already been converted and established for a different clade, another preexisting name that has been widely and recently applied to the clade concerned (or to a paraphyletic group originating with the same ancestor) may be selected.  On the other hand, continuity with existing literature and consistency with rank-based nomenclature are not well served by resurrecting old and little-known names.  Therefore, if there is no other name that has been widely applied to the clade in the recent past, a new name should be selected that consists of the most widely used preexisting name with a taxon-related prefix added, such as <span class="name-affix">Phyto-</span> for plants, <span class="name-affix">Phyco-</span> for &quot;algae&quot; (excluding cyanobacteria), and <span class="name-affix">Myco-</span> for fungi (three groups of organisms whose names are governed by the <a href="glossay.html#term-icbn" class="title">ICBN</a>), <span class="name-affix">Zoo-</span> for animals and other organisms whose names are governed by the <a href="./glossary.html#term-iczn" class="title">ICZN</a>, and <span class="name-affix">Monero-</span> for organisms whose names are governed by the <a href="./glossary.html#term-icnb" class="title">ICNB</a> and cyanobacteria (governed by the <a href="./glossary.html#term-icbn" class="title">ICBN</a>).  If there is another preexisting name that has been widely applied to the clade in the recent past, the choice between converting this name and establishing a new name with a taxon-related prefix is left to the discretion of the author.

										In rank-based nomenclature, previously undiscovered homonymy occasionally occurs within a single rank-based code, although only one of the homonyms can be legitimate (<a href="./glossary.html#term-icbn" class="title">ICBN</a>, <a href="./glossary.html#term-icnb" class="title">ICNB</a>) or potentially valid (<a href="./glossary.html#term-iczn" class="title">ICZN</a>) once the homonymy is discovered.  Only one member of each set of homonyms is, after conversion, an acceptable name under this code (<a href="art13.html#art13.3">Art. 13.3</a>). Once a case of homonymy within a rank-based code is discovered, it is generally rectified by replacing the junior homonym with an already existing synonym or a new replacement name.  However, if a user of this code is the first to discover a case of homonymy within one of the rank-based codes, the names should be defined in a manner that is consistent with the way in which they will likely be applied under the rank-based code when the situation is rectified.  Specifically, the homonym that will likely have precedence under the rank-based code (i.e., generally the one that was published earlier) should be the one that is converted under this code.  For the other homonym, the synonym (if one exists) that will likely be applied to this taxon under the rank-based code should be converted, provided that this synonym qualifies as a preexisting name for the clade of concern (see <a href="art9.html#art9.8">Art. 9.8</a>).

										Under rank-based nomenclature, the name (or epithet; see below) of a subdivision of a genus that contains the type species must be the same as that of the genus.  Only one member of each such pair of names is, after conversion, an acceptable name under this code (<a href="art13.html#art13.3">Art. 13.3</a>).  Furthermore, under the <a href="./glossary.html#term-icbn" class="title">ICBN</a>, names of subdivisions of genera (e.g., subgenera, sections, series) consist of a generic name combined with a subdivisional epithet.  These epithets, like specific epithets, are not necessarily unique; the same epithet may be combined with the names of different genera without creating homonyms.  Only one member of each set of identically spelled subdivisional epithets is, after conversion, an acceptable name under this code (<a href="art13.html#art13.3">Art. 13.3</a>).  If the preexisting subdivisional name (<a href="./glossary.html#term-iczn" class="title">ICZN</a>, <a href="./glossary.html#term-icnb" class="title">ICNB</a>) or epithet (<a href="./glossary.html#term-icbn" class="title">ICBN</a>) that has been most widely used for a particular clade cannot be converted because an identically spelled name has already been converted and established for a different clade, another preexisting name or epithet that has been widely and recently applied to the clade concerned (or to a paraphyletic group originating with the same ancestor) may be selected.

Therefore, if there is no other name or epithet that has been widely applied to the clade in the recent past, a new name should be selected that consists of the most widely used preexisting name or epithet, preceded by the name of the genus in rank-based nomenclature, with both words capitalized and connected by a hyphen.  If there is another preexisting name or epithet that has been widely applied to the clade in the recent past, the choice between converting this name or epithet and establishing a new name that combines the preexisting genus name and subdivisional name or epithet is left to the discretion of the author.

										When establishing a name for a crown clade that, under rank-based nomenclature, corresponds to a monogeneric &quot;higher&quot; taxon, the genus name should be converted for that clade rather than any of the suprageneric names that have been applied to it.  Doing so will permit the use of the &quot;higher&quot; taxon names for more inclusive clades that extend beyond the crown.

											In rank-based nomenclature, the names <span class="ranked-name">Equisetophyta</span>, <span class="ranked-name">Equisetopsida</span>, <span class="ranked-name">Equisetales</span>, <span class="ranked-name">Equisetaceae</span>, and <span class="ranked-name">Equisetum</span> have all been used to refer to the same crown clade, which is widely understood to include only the genus <span class="ranked-name">Equisetum</span>.  (Most of these names have also been used to refer to more inclusive clades that contain extinct species outside the crown.)  When selecting a name to convert for the crown clade, <span class="ranked-name">Equisetum</span> should be chosen.  The names <span class="ranked-name">Equisetaceae</span>, <span class="ranked-name">Equisetales</span>, etc. are better applied to clades that are more inclusive than the crown.
