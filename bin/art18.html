									Subsequent Use and Correction of Established Names
								</div>
								<div id="art18.1" class="rule">
									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">18.1.</span>
										The original spelling of a name established under this code is the correct spelling and should be retained in subsequent publications, except for the correction of typographical errors (see <a href="#art18.5">Art. 18.5</a>).  The original spelling is the one that is used in the protologue at the time of establishment and that is registered (see <a href="art8.html">Art. 8</a>).
									</div>
									<div id="note18.1.1" class="note">
										<div class="para">
											<span class="label">Note 18.1.1.</span>
											The original spelling of a converted name is correct so long as it is based on one of the spellings of the preexisting name, even if the prevailing spelling was not adopted (see <a href="art17.html#rec17.5a">Rec. 17.5A</a>).
										</div>
									</div>
									<div id="note18.1.2" class="note">
										<div class="para">
											<span class="label">Note 18.1.2.</span>
											Use of a diaeresis to indicate that a vowel is to be pronounced separately from the preceding vowel is not part of the spelling (orthography) of a name, but it may be included in an established name as an optional pronunciation guide.  Similarly, use of an apostrophe to indicate a break between syllables is not part of the spelling of a name, but it may be included in an established name as an optional pronunciation guide.
										</div>
									</div>
								</div>
								<div id="art18.2" class="rule">
									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">18.2.</span>
										Spellings that do not follow <a href="art17.html#rec17b">Rec. 17B</a> (for example, incorrect latinization or use of an inappropriate connecting vowel) and spellings that contain incorrect transliterations are not to be corrected.
									</div>
								</div>
								<div id="art18.3" class="rule">
									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">18.3.</span>
										If the registered spelling of a name disagrees with the spelling in the protologue or the name is spelled more than one way in the protologue, the author should determine which is correct and notify the registration database administrator promptly.
									</div>
									<div id="note18.3.1" class="note">
										<div class="para">
											<span class="label">Note 18.3.1</span>
											If the author notifies the database administrator that the registered spelling is incorrect, the administrator will correct the database and insert a note that the change was made.  If one or more spellings in the protologue are incorrect, the administrator will annotate the database to alert users that this is the case.
										</div>
									</div>
								</div>
								<div id="art18.4" class="rule">
									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">18.4.</span>
										If the registered spelling of a name disagrees with the spelling in the protologue or the name is spelled more than one way in the protologue, and the author is no longer alive or is otherwise unable to determine which spelling is correct, the following guidelines are to be used: If it is clear that all but one of the spellings are typographical errors, the remaining one is treated as correct.  If it is not clear which spellings are typographical errors, the one that is most consistent with <a href="art17.html#rec17b">Rec. 17B</a> is treated as correct.  If it is not clear which spellings are typographical errors, and it is not clear that one is more consistent with <a href="art17.html#rec17b">Rec. 17B</a> than the others, the one immediately associated with the designation &quot;new clade name,&quot; &quot;converted clade name,&quot; etc. is treated as correct.  Such decisions regarding the correct spelling of a name if made by anyone other than the author, must be published (<a href="art4-5.html#art4">Art. 4</a>) before the registration database administrator is notified (see <a href="art18.html#rec18a">Rec. 18A</a>).
									</div>
									<div id="note18.4.1" class="note">
										<div class="para">
											<span class="label">Note 18.4.1.</span>
											If the author of a published correction notifies the database administrator that the registered spelling is incorrect, the administrator will correct the database and insert a note that the change was made.  If one or more spellings in the protologue are incorrect, the administrator will annotate the database to alert users that this is the case.
										</div>
									</div>
									<div id="rec18.4a" class="recommendation">
										<div class="para">
											<span class="label">Recommendation 18.4A.</span>
											The person making an orthographic correction of the sort covered by <a href="#art18.4">Art. 18.4</a> should notify the database administrator promptly after publishing it.
										</div>
									</div>
								</div>
								<div id="art18.5" class="rule">
									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">18.5.</span>
										If the registered spelling of a name and the spelling in the protologue agree but contain a typographical error, the author may publish a correction.  If the author is no longer alive or is otherwise unable to correct the error, any person may publish a correction (see <a href="#rec18a">Rec. 18A</a>).
									</div>
									<div id="note18.5.1" class="note">
										<div class="para">
											<span class="label">Note 18.5.1.</span>
											After the registration database administrator is notified, the spelling will be corrected in the database and a note will be added stating that the change was made.
										</div>
									</div>
									<div id="note18.5.2" class="note">
										<div class="para">
											<span class="label">Note 18.5.2.</span>
											A correction slip inserted in the original publication does not qualify as a published correction.  Publication of corrections must satisfy the requirements of <a href="art4-5.html#art4">Art. 4</a>.
										</div>
									</div>
								</div>
								<div id="art18.6" class="rule">
									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">18.6.</span>
										Accidental misspellings of a name that appear in print subsequent to establishment are not to be treated as new names but as incorrect spellings of the established name.  The same is true of unjustified corrections (i.e., any correction that does not fall under Arts. <a href="#art18.3">18.3</a>&ndash;<a href="#art18.5">18.5</a>, particularly those that violate <a href="#art18.2">Art. 18.2</a>).
									</div>
								</div>
								<div id="rec18a" class="recommendation">
									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">Recommendation 18A.</span>
										The person making an orthographic correction of the sort covered by Arts. <a href="#art18.4">18.4</a> and <a href="#art18.5">18.5</a> should notify the database administrator promptly after publishing it.
