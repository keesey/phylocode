										Specifiers are species, specimens, or apomorphies cited in a phylogenetic definition of a name as reference points that serve to specify the clade to which the name applies.  All specifiers used in node-based and branch-based definitions of clade names, and one of the specifiers used in apomorphy-based definitions of clade names, are species or specimens.  The other specifier used in an apomorphy-based definition of a clade name is an apomorphy.
									</div>
									<div id="note11.1.1" class="note">
										<div class="para">
											<span class="label">Note 11.1.1.</span>
											When a species is cited as a specifier, the implicit specifier is the type of that species name (if a type has been designated) under the appropriate rank-based code.
                      Therefore, whichever currently accepted species includes the type specimen of the species name cited in the definition is the specifier.
                      If the species name originally cited as a specifier is no longer accepted, either because the species has been recircumscribed or assigned to a different genus under rank-based nomenclature, then the species name with which it has been synonymized automatically becomes the name of the specifier species.
                      However, the type of the name originally used as a specifier, rather than that of the currently accepted species name, remains the implicit specifier.
                      If the type of a specifier species name changes under the rank-based code, the implicit specifier changes accordingly.
                      A species may be used as a specifier even if it lacks a type.

										An internal specifier is a species, specimen or apomorphy that is explicitly included in the clade whose name is being defined; an external specifier is a species or specimen that is explicitly excluded from it.  All specifiers in apomorphy-based, standard node-based and apomorphy-modified node-based definitions are internal, but branch-based and branch-modified node-based definitions always have at least one specifier of each type.

										In the interest of consistency with the rank-based codes, it would be desirable for a clade whose name is converted from a typified name under a rank-based code, or is derived from the stem of a such a name, to include the type of the that name.  Therefore, when a clade name is converted from a preexisting typified name or is a new or converted name derived from the stem of a typified name, the definition of the clade name must use the type species of that preexisting typified name or of the genus name from which it is derived (or the type specimen of that species) as an internal specifier.

										Definitions of converted clade names should be stated in a way that attempts to capture the spirit of traditional use to the degree that it is consistent with the contemporary concept of monophyly.  Consequently, they should not necessitate, though they may allow, the inclusion of subtaxa that have traditionally been excluded from the taxon, as well as the exclusion of subtaxa that have traditionally been included in the taxon.  To accomplish this goal, internal specifiers of converted clade names should be chosen from among the set of taxa that have been considered to form part of a taxon under traditional ideas about the composition of that taxon, and they should not include members of subtaxa that have traditionally been considered not to be part of the taxon.

											The name <span class="ranked-name">Dinosauria</span> was coined by Owen for the taxa <span class="ranked-name">Megalosaurus</span>, <span class="ranked-name">Iguanodon</span>, and <span class="ranked-name">Hylaeosaurus</span>, and traditionally the taxon designated by that name has included these and certain other non-volant reptiles.  It has not traditionally included birds.  Although birds are now considered part of the dinosaur clade, the name <span class="clade-name">Dinosauria</span> should not be defined using any bird species as internal specifiers.  Such a definition would force birds to be dinosaurs, thus trivializing the question of whether birds are dinosaurs.  Instead, internal specifiers should be chosen from among taxa that have traditionally been considered dinosaurs; e.g., <span class="prenomen ranked-name">Megalosaurus</span> <span class="species-name">bucklandii</span> Mantell 1827, <span class="prenomen ranked-name">Iguanodon</span> <span class="species-name">bernissartensis</span> Boulenger in Beneden 1881, and <span class="prenomen ranked-name">Hylaeosaurus</span> <span class="species-name">armatus</span> Mantell 1833.

										<span class="label">Recommendation 11C.</span>
										It follows from <a href="#rec11b">Rec. 11B</a> that phylogenetic definitions of clade names should not use as specifiers species whose type specimens are ambiguous (e.g., because they are lost or fragmentary).  Because they are commonly based on ambiguous types, ichnotaxa (taxa based on the fossilized work of organisms, including fossilized trails, tracks, and burrows; <a href="./glossary.html#term-iczn" class="title">ICZN</a> [1999] glossary, Art. 1.2.1), ootaxa (taxa based on fossilized eggs), and morphotaxa (fossil taxa that, for nomenclatural purposes, comprise only the parts, life history stages, or preservational states represented by the corresponding nomenclatural types; <a href="./glossary.html#term-icbn" class="title">ICBN</a> [2006] Art. 1.2) should not be used as specifiers.  When this recommendation is combined with <a href="#art11.7">Art. 11.7</a>, it follows that clade names should not be based on the names of ichnotaxa, ootaxa, or morphotaxa.

										In a node-based definition, it is best to use a set of internal specifiers that includes representatives of all subclades that credible evidence suggests may be basal within the clade being named, unless doing so would be contrary to Rec. <a href="#rec11a">11A</a> and/or <a href="#rec11b">11B</a>. Constructing a node-based definition in this way will reduce the chance that, under a new phylogenetic hypothesis, the name will refer to a less inclusive clade than originally intended.

										If it is important to establish two names as applying to sister clades regardless of the phylogeny, reciprocal branch-based definitions should be used in which the single internal specifier of one is the single external specifier of the other, and vice versa.  To establish a name as applying to the larger clade composed of those two sister-clades, the name of the former should be given a node-based definition using the same two internal specifiers (<a href="#rec11f-example1">Example 1</a>).  A similar approach may be used to establish two names as referring to crown clades that are each other's closest extant relatives by using reciprocal branch-modified node-based definitions (<a href="#rec11f-example2">Example 2</a>).

										Clade names created by adding certain prefixes or suffixes to another clade name (the base name) should be defined in a manner consistent with the hierarchical relationships implied by the prefix or suffix and the phylogenetic definition of the base name (if established), unless doing so would be inconsistent with the predominant current use of a preexisting name.

											If preexisting names <span class="ranked-name">Parahebe</span> and <span class="ranked-name">Hebe</span> are converted, the internal specifiers of each name should not include any member of the other clade, but this alone will not ensure the mutual exclusivity implied by the name <span class="ranked-name">Parahebe</span>.  Mutual exclusivity can be ensured by using the type of each name as an external specifier for the other name, or by including a qualifying clause making the name <span class="clade-name">Parahebe</span> inapplicable in the context of any phylogeny in which the two clades are not mutually exclusive.  However, neither of these approaches should be taken if the accepted usage (at the time when the definition is prepared) treats <span class="ranked-name">Hebe</span> and <span class="ranked-name">Parahebe</span> as nested.
