In (b), fusion of species G and H to form species Y (with the two parent species disappearing in the process) results in partial overlap between the most inclusive clade containing E but not J (or the least inclusive clade containing both E and G), which is composed of E, F, G, and Y, and the most inclusive clade containing J but not E (or the least inclusive clade containing both H and J), which is composed of H, I, J, and Y, in that Y is part of both clades.</div>

									<ul>
										<li>A node-based clade is a clade originating with a particular node on a phylogenetic tree, where the node represents a lineage at the instant of a splitting event.</li>
										<li>A branch-based clade is a clade originating with a particular branch (internode) on a phylogenetic tree, where the branch represents a lineage between two splitting events.</li>
										<li>An apomorphy-based clade is a clade originating with the ancestor in which a particular derived character state (apomorphy) originated.</li>
										<li>A crown clade is a node-based clade originating with the most recent common ancestor of two or more extant species (or organisms).</li>
										<li>A total clade is a branch-based clade composed of a crown clade and all organisms (and species) that share a more recent common ancestor with that crown clade than with any extant organisms or species that are not members of that crown clade.</li>

                      Here and elsewhere in this code, &quot;phylogenetic tree&quot; is used loosely to include any directed graph, specifically those with additional connections representing phenomena such as hybridization (see <a href="#note2.1.3">Note 2.1.3</a>).

									Hierarchy and Rank
								</div>
								<div id="art3.1" class="rule">
									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">3.1.</span>
										The system of nomenclature described in this code is independent of categorical rank.  Although clades are hierarchically related, and therefore intrinsically ranked in the sense that some are more inclusive than others, assignment of categorical ranks (e.g., genus, family, etc.) is not part of the formal naming process and has no bearing on the spelling or application of clade names.
									</div>
									<div id="art3.1-example1" class="example">
										<div class="para">
											<span class="label">Example 1.</span>
											If the name <span class="clade-name">Iguanidae</span> were defined as referring to a clade originally ranked as a family, and if that clade were later ranked as a subfamily and (at the same time) a more inclusive clade ranked as a family, the reference of the name <span class="clade-name">Iguanidae</span> would not change to the more inclusive clade, nor would the spelling of that name change (i.e., to <span class="clade-name">Iguaninae</span>) to reflect the new rank of the clade to which it refers.
										</div>
									</div>
									<div id="note3.1.1" class="note">
										<div class="para">
											<span class="label">Note 3.1.1.</span>
											In this code, the terms &quot;species&quot; and &quot;clade&quot; refer to different kinds of biological entities, not ranks.
										</div>
									</div>
									<div id="note3.1.2" class="note">
										<div class="para">
											<span class="label">Note 3.1.2.</span>
											This code does not prohibit, discourage, encourage, or require the use of taxonomic ranks.
										</div>
									</div>
								</div>
								<div id="art3.2" class="rule">
									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">3.2.</span>
										The concepts of synonymy, homonymy, and precedence adopted in this code (see Arts. <a href="art12.html">12</a>&ndash;<a href="art14.html">14</a>) are, in contrast to the rank-based codes, independent of categorical rank.
