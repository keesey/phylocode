									Conservation, Suppression, and Emendation
								</div>
								<div id="art15.1" class="rule">
									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">15.1.</span>
										Conservation of names and emendation of definitions are means of overriding precedence based on date of establishment (<a href="art12.html#art12.2">Art. 12.2</a>) in the interest of stability (e.g., in terms of composition and/or diagnostic characters).
									</div>
								</div>
								<div id="art15.2" class="rule">
									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">15.2.</span>
										Conservation of names is possible only under extraordinary circumstances and requires approval of the Committee on Phylogenetic Nomenclature (CPN; see <a href="art22.html">Art. 22</a>).
									</div>
								</div>
								<div id="art15.3" class="rule">
									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">15.3.</span>
										Once a name has been conserved, the entry for the affected name in the registration database is to be annotated to indicate its conserved status relative to other names that are simultaneously suppressed.  The entries for suppressed names are to be similarly annotated.
									</div>
								</div>
								<div id="art15.4" class="rule">
									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">15.4.</span>
										In the case of heterodefinitional synonyms, the earlier name may be conditionally suppressed so that it may be used when not considered synonymous with the later name.  In the case of homonyms and homodefinitional synonyms, suppression is unconditional.
									</div>
								</div>
								<div id="art15.5" class="rule">
									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">15.5.</span>
										When a name is unconditionally suppressed, there are no conditions under which it has precedence with regard to either synonymy or homonymy.  Therefore, if a homodefinitional synonym has been suppressed, that name can be established subsequently with a different definition as an acceptable name.
									</div>
								</div>
								<div id="art15.6" class="rule">
									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">15.6.</span>
										When a conserved name competes with names against which it has not been explicitly conserved, the earliest established of the competing names has precedence.
									</div>
								</div>
								<div id="art15.7" class="rule">
									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">15.7.</span>
										Although names are normally suppressed only when a synonym or homonym is conserved, the CPN may unconditionally suppress a name if it is nomenclaturally disruptive, without necessarily conserving an alternative.  An unconditionally suppressed name can be established subsequently with a different definition as an acceptable name.
									</div>

								<div id="art15.8" class="rule">
									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">15.8.</span>
										An emendation is a formal change in a phylogenetic definition. A restricted emendation requires approval by the CPN (see <a href="art22.html">Art. 22</a>), while an unrestricted emendation may be published without CPN approval.
									</div>

									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">15.10.</span>
										A restricted emendation (see <a href="#art15.8">Art. 15.8</a>) is intended to change the application of a particular name through a change in the conceptualization of the clade to which it refers.  Restricted emendations may involve changes in definitional type, clade category, specifiers, and/or qualifying clauses.

											A restricted emendation is a mechanism to correct a definition that fails to associate a name with the clade to which it has traditionally referred, even in the context of the reference phylogeny adopted by the original definitional author.
										</div>
										<div id="note15.10.1-example1" class="example">

												<span class="label">Example 1.</span>
												Suppose the name Angiospermae had been defined as the least inclusive clade containing <span class="ranked-name prenomen">Zea</span> <span class="species-name">mays</span> Linnaeus 1753 and <span class="ranked-name prenomen">Gnetum</span> <span class="species-name">gnemon</span> Linnaeus 1767.  By including <span class="ranked-name">Gnetum</span>, this definition specifies a more inclusive clade than the one to which the name <span class="clade-name">Angiospermae</span> traditionally refers.  Correcting the definition would qualify as a restricted emendation (i.e., it would require approval by the CPN).

										</div>
									</div>
								</div>
								<div id="art15.11" class="rule">
									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">15.11.</span>
										An unrestricted emendation (see <a href="#art15.8">Art. 15.8</a>) is intended to preserve the application of a particular name in terms of the conceptualization of the clade to which it refers.  Unrestricted emendations may involve changes in specifiers or qualifying clauses, or clarification of the meaning of "extant", but must retain the same definition type (node-based, branch-based, or apomorphy-based), the same clade category (i.e., crown clade, total clade) if category was specified in the protologue, and the same clade conceptualization as interpreted from the protologue.

									<div id="note15.11.1" class="note">
										<div class="para">
											<span class="label">Note 15.11.1.</span>
											An unrestricted emendation is a mechanism to prevent undesirable changes in the application of a particular name (in terms of clade conceptualization) when the original definition is applied in the context of a revised phylogeny.
										</div>
										<div id="note15.11.1-example1" class="example">
											<div class="para">
												<span class="label">Example 1.</span>
												Several recent phylogenetic analyses suggest that <span class="prenomen ranked-name">Amborella</span> <span class="species-name">trichopoda</span> is sister to the rest of <span class="clade-name">Angiospermae</span>, but evidence for this basalmost position of <span class="clade-name">Angiospermae</span> was not discovered until the late 1990s.  If, prior to this discovery, <span class="clade-name">Angiospermae</span> had been given a node-based definition that did not include <span class="ranked-name">Amborella</span> <span class="species-name">trichopoda</span> as an internal specifier, <span class="clade-name">Angiospermae</span> would not have included <span class="ranked-name">Amborella</span> after its basal position was discovered.  However, the definitional author would presumably have intended for <span class="ranked-name">Amborella</span> to be included in <span class="clade-name">Angiospermae</span> because it has most of the synapomorphies of that taxon and has always been included in it.  In such a situation, an unrestricted emendation that adds <span class="prenomen">Amborella</span> <span class="species-name">trichopoda</span> to the list of internal specifiers would avoid an undesirable change in clade composition and would be consistent with the clade conceptualization of the original definitional author and with historical use.

										</div>
									</div>
									<div id="note15.11.2" class="note">
										<div class="para">
											<span class="label">Note 15.11.2.</span>
											In the context of this article, node-based, branch-modified node-based and apomorphy-modified node-based definitions are all considered the same definition type, so it is permissible for an unrestricted emendation to change from one to another of these three variants of the node-based definition, provided that all internal specifiers are extant.
										</div>
										<div id="note15.11.2-example1" class="example">
											<div class="para">
												<span class="label">Example 1.</span>
												In the situation described in <a href="#note15.11.1-example1">Note 15.11.1, Example 1</a>, as an alternative to adding <span class="prenomen ranked-name">Amborella</span> <span class="species-name">trichopoda</span> to the list of specifiers, it might be preferable to change the original node-based definition to a branch-modified node-based definition such as &quot;the most inclusive crown clade containing <span class="ranked-name prenomen">Zea</span> <span class="species-name">mays</span> Linnaeus 1753 but not <span class="ranked-name prenomen">Cycas</span> <span class="species-name">circinalis</span> Linnaeus 1753, <span class="ranked-name prenomen">Gnetum</span> <span class="species-name">gnemon</span> Linnaeus 1767, <span class="ranked-name prenomen">Ginkgo</span> <span class="species-name">biloba</span> Linnaeus 1771, and <span class="ranked-name prenomen">Pinus</span> <span class="species-name">sylvestris</span> Linnaeus 1753.&quot; Such a definition avoids the need for further emendation if some other species (i.e., other than <span class="ranked-name prenomen">Amborella</span> <span class="species-name">trichopoda</span>) or subclade is inferred in the future to be sister to the rest of the <span class="clade-name-informal">angiosperms</span>.

									<div id="note15.11.3" class="note">
										<div class="para">
											<span class="label">Note 15.11.3.</span>
											If it is specified in the protologue that the name refers to a crown clade or a total clade, this clade category may not be changed through an unrestricted emendation.  If the clade category is not specified in the protologue, the category may still play a role in determining the author's conceptualization of the clade (see <a href="#note15.11.4">Note 15.11.4</a> and <a href="#art15.13-example1">Art. 15.13, Example 1</a>).  The category of crown clade is considered to be specified in the protologue if the definition is: <span class="list"><span class="list-item">1) branch-modified node-based;</span> <span class="list-item">2) apomorphy-modified node-based;</span> or <span class="list-item">3) standard node-based and the author states in the protologue that the name applies to a crown clade.</span></span>  The category of total clade is considered to be specified in the protologue if: <span class="list"><span class="list-item">1) a panclade name and definition (Arts. <a href="art10.html#art10.3">10.3</a>, <a href="art10.html#art10.5">10.5</a>) are used;</span> or <span class="list-item">2) a branch-based definition is used and the author states in the protologue that the name applies to a total clade.</span></span>

									<div id="note15.11.4" class="note">
										<div class="para">
											<span class="label">Note 15.11.4.</span>
											Interpretation of the original definitional author's clade conceptualization is based on the definition and all other information in the protologue.  Important components of the definitional author's conceptualization of the clade include (but are not necessarily restricted to) composition, synapomorphies, clade category (e.g., crown versus non-crown; see <a href="#art15.13-example1">Art. 15.13, Example 1</a>), the existence of a basal dichotomy into two particular subclades (see <a href="#art15.13-example2">Art. 15.13, Example 2</a>), and conceptualization of a clade as an entire branch regardless of composition (see <a href="#art15.13-example3">Art. 15.13, Example 3</a>).

								</div>
								<div id="art15.12" class="rule">
									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">15.12.</span>
										The protologue of an unrestricted emendation must provide evidence that the conceptualization of the clade is the same as that of the original definitional author.  The protologue must also explain why the emended definition is preferable to the definition being emended.

								</div>
								<div id="art15.13" class="rule">
									<div class="para">
										<span class="label">15.13.</span>
										If conflicting evidence from the protologue (see <a href="#note15.11.4">Note 15.11.4</a>) makes it unclear whether a proposed emendation is consistent with the original conceptualization of the clade, the emendation must be considered by the CPN (i.e., it must be a restricted emendation).  Disagreements within the systematics community as to whether a published unrestricted emendation changes the conceptualization of a clade (i.e., whether the emendation should have been restricted) are to be resolved by referring the issue to the CPN for a decision (see <a href="art22.html">Art. 22</a>).
