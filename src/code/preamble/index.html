            <section id="preamble-1">
                1. Biology requires a precise, coherent, international system for naming clades. Scientific names have
                long been governed by the traditional codes (listed in <a href="#preamble-4">Preamble item 4</a>), but
                those codes do not provide
                a means to give stable, unambiguous names to clades. This code satisfies that need by providing rules
                for naming clades and describing the nomenclatural principles that form the basis for those rules.
            </section>
            <section id="preamble-2">
                2. This code is applicable to the names of all clades of organisms, whether extant or extinct.
            </section>
            <section id="preamble-3">
                3. This code may be used concurrently with the rank-based codes.
            </section>
            <section id="preamble-4">
                4. Although this code relies on the rank-based codes (i.e., <cite>International Code of Nomenclature for
                    Algae, Fungi, and Plants (Melbourne Code)</cite> (<cite><abbr title="International Code of Nomenclature for
                Algae, Fungi, and Plants">ICNAFP</abbr></cite><a href="#footnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a>),
                <cite>International Code of Zoological Nomenclature</cite>
                (<cite><abbr title="">ICZN</abbr></cite>),
                <cite>International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</cite> (<cite><abbr
                        title="International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes">ICNP</abbr></cite>),
                <cite>International Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature</cite> (<cite><abbr
                        title="International Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature">ICVCN</abbr></cite>)
                to determine the acceptability of preexisting names, it governs
                the application of those names independently from the rank-based codes.
            </section>
            <section id="preamble-5">
                5. This code includes rules, recommendations, notes, and examples. Rules are mandatory in that names
                contrary to them have no official standing under this code. Recommendations are not mandatory in that
                names contrary to them cannot be rejected on that basis. Systematists are encouraged to follow them in
                the interest of promoting nomenclatural uniformity and clarity, but editors and reviewers should not
                require that they be followed. Notes and examples are intended solely for clarification.

                6. This code will take effect on the publication of <cite>Phylonyms: A Companion to the
                    PhyloCode</cite>, and it is
                not retroactive.
