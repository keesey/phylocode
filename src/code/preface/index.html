                    The development of the <cite>International Code of Phylogenetic Nomenclature</cite> (referred to
                    here as
                    the
                    <cite>PhyloCode</cite>) grew out of the recognition that the current rank-based systems of
                    nomenclature,
                    as
                    embodied in the current botanical, zoological, and bacteriological codes, are not well suited to
                    govern
                    the names of clades. Clades (along with species) are the entities that make up the tree of life, and
                    for
                    this reason they are among the most theoretically significant biological entities above the organism
                    level. Consequently, clear communication and efficient storage and retrieval of biological
                    information
                    require names that explicitly and unambiguously refer to clades and do not change over time. The
                    current
                    rank-based codes fail to provide such names for clades. Supraspecific names are not always
                    associated
                    with clades under the rank-based codes, and even when they are, they often fail to retain their
                    associations with particular clades because the names are implicitly defined in terms of ranks and
                    types. A clade whose hypothesized composition and diagnostic characters have not changed may be
                    given a
                    different name under the rank-based codes based purely on considerations of rank. Such instability
                    is
                    particularly objectionable given the wide recognition that rank assignment is subjective and of
                    dubious
                    biological significance.

                    In contrast to the rank-based codes, the <cite>PhyloCode</cite> provides rules for the express
                    purpose
                    of
                    naming clades through explicit reference to phylogeny. In doing so, the <cite>PhyloCode</cite>
                    extends
                    “tree-thinking” to biological nomenclature. This development parallels the extension of
                    tree-thinking
                    into taxonomy, as manifested in the concepts of species as lineage segments and supraspecific taxa
                    as
                    clades. These nomenclatural and taxonomic developments are complementary but independent. Clades can
                    be
                    named using the traditional rank-based systems of nomenclature (though with the problems noted
                    above),
                    and a nomenclatural system based on phylogenetic principles does not require equating supraspecific
                    taxa
                    with clades. The <cite>PhyloCode</cite>, however, is designed for the specific purpose of naming
                    clades.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The objective of the <cite>PhyloCode</cite> is not to replace existing names but to provide an
                    alternative
                    system for governing the application of both existing and newly proposed names. In developing the
                    <cite>PhyloCode</cite>, much thought has been given to minimizing disruption of the existing
                    nomenclature.
                    Thus, rules and recommendations have been included to ensure that most names will be applied in ways
                    that approximate their current and/or historical use. However, names that apply to clades will be
                    redefined in terms of phylogenetic relationships rather than taxonomic rank and therefore will not
                    be
                    subject to the subsequent changes that occur under the rank-based systems due to changes in rank.
                    Because the taxon membership associated with particular names will sometimes differ between
                    rank-based
                    and phylogenetic systems, suggestions are provided for indicating which code governs a name when
                    there
                    is a possibility of confusion. Mechanisms are also provided to reduce certain types of nomenclatural
                    divergence relative to the rank-based systems. For example, if a clade name is based on a genus
                    name,
                    the type of the genus under the appropriate rank-based code must be used as an internal specifier

                    volume that provides phylogenetic definitions for many widely used clade names and the names of many
                    large clades (see below). Names for which phylogenetic definitions were published before that date,
                    and
                    not subsequently, are not considered established under this code.

                <h5>Properties of Phylogenetic Nomenclature</h5>
                <p>
                    The phylogenetic system of nomenclature embodied in the <cite>PhyloCode</cite> exhibits both
                    similarities to and differences from the rank-based systems embodied in the traditional codes. Some
                    of the most important similarities are as follows: (1) Both systems have the same fundamental goals
                    of providing unambiguous methods for applying names to taxa, selecting a single accepted name for a
                    taxon from among competing synonyms or homonyms, and promoting nomenclatural stability and
                    continuity to the extent that doing so does not contradict new results and conclusions. (2) Neither
                    system infringes upon the judgment of taxonomists with respect to inferring the composition of taxa
                    or to assigning taxonomic ranks. (3) Both systems use precedence, a clear order of preference, to
                    determine the correct name of a taxon when synonyms or homonyms exist. (4) Both systems use the date
                    of publication (chronological priority) as the primary criterion for establishing precedence. (5)
                    And both phylogenetic and rank-based systems have conservation mechanisms that allow a
                    later-established name to be given precedence over an earlier name for the same taxon if using the
                    earlier name would be contrary to the fundamental goal of promoting nomenclatural stability and
                    continuity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the most important differences between the phylogenetic system of the <cite>PhyloCode</cite>
                    and
                    the rank-based systems of the traditional codes are as follows: (1) The phylogenetic system is
                    independent of taxonomic rank. Although clades form nested hierarchies, the assignment of taxonomic
                    rank is not part of the naming process and has no bearing on the spelling or application of clade
                    names. As a consequence, the phylogenetic system does not require ranked taxonomies. (2) All taxa
                    named under this code are clades. Clades are products of evolution that have an objective existence
                    regardless of whether they are named. As a consequence, once a clade is named and its name
                    associated with a phylogenetic definition, its composition and diagnostic characters become
                    questions to be decided by empirical evidence rather than by personal decisions. (3) In addition to
                    applying names to nested and mutually exclusive taxa, as in traditional nomenclature, the
                    phylogenetic system allows names to be applied to partially overlapping clades. This provision is
                    necessary to accommodate situations involving clades of hybrid origin. (4) In contrast to the
                    rank-based codes, which use (implicit) definitions based on ranks and types to determine the
                    application of names, phylogenetic nomenclature uses explicit phylogenetic definitions. Species,
                    specimens, and apomorphies cited within these definitions are called <em
                        class="nomen">specifiers</em> because
                    they are
                    used to specify the clade to which the name applies. These specifiers function analogously to the
                    types of rank-based nomenclature in providing reference points that determine the application of a
                    name; however, they differ from types in that they may either be included in or excluded from the
                    taxon being named, and multiple specifiers may be used. (5) The fundamental difference between the
                    phylogenetic and rank-based systems in how names are defined leads to differences in how synonyms
                    and homonyms are determined in practice. For example, under the <cite>PhyloCode</cite>, synonyms are
                    names whose phylogenetic definitions specify the same clade, regardless of prior associations with
                    particular ranks; in contrast, under the rank-based codes, synonyms are names at the same rank whose
                    types are included within a single taxon at that rank, regardless of prior associations with
                    particular clades. (6) Another novel aspect of the <cite>PhyloCode</cite> is that it permits
                    taxonomists
                    to restrict the application of names with respect to clade composition. If a taxonomist wishes to
                    ensure that a name refers to a clade that either includes or excludes particular taxa, this result
                    may be achieved through the use of additional internal or external specifiers (beyond the minimal
                    number needed to specify a clade), or the definition may contain a qualifying clause specifying
                    conditions under which the name cannot be used. (7) The <cite>PhyloCode</cite> includes recommended
                    naming conventions that promote an integrated system of names for crown and total clades. The
                    resulting pairs of names (e.g., <em class="nomen">Testudines</em> and <em
                        class="nomen">Pan-Testudines</em> for the turtle crown
                    and total clades, respectively) enhance the cognitive efficiency of the system and provide
                    hierarchical information. (8) Establishment of a name under the <cite>PhyloCode</cite> requires both
                    publication and registration. The purpose of registration is to create a comprehensive database of
                    established names (discussed below), which will reduce the frequency of accidental homonyms and
                    facilitate the retrieval of nomenclatural information.

                <h5>Advantages of Phylogenetic Nomenclature</h5>
                <p>
                    Phylogenetic nomenclature has several advantages over the traditional systems. It eliminates a major
                    source of instability under the rank-based codes—changes in clade names due solely to shifts in
                    rank. It also facilitates the naming of new clades as they are discovered. Under the rank-based
                    codes, it is often difficult to name clades one at a time, similar to the way that species are
                    named, because the name of a taxon is affected by the taxon’s rank, which in turn depends on the
                    ranks of more and less inclusive taxa. In a group in which the standard ranks are already in use,
                    naming a newly discovered clade requires either the use of an unconventional intermediate rank
                    (e.g., supersubfamily) or the shifting of less or more inclusive clades to lower or higher ranks,
                    thus causing a cascade of name changes. This situation discourages systematists from naming clades
                    until an entire classification is developed. In the meanwhile, well-supported clades are left
                    unnamed, and taxonomy falls progressively farther behind knowledge of phylogeny. This is a
                    particularly serious drawback at the present time, when advances in molecular and computational
                    biology have led to a burst of new information about phylogeny, much of which is not being
                    incorporated into taxonomy. The availability of the <cite>PhyloCode</cite> will permit researchers
                    to name newly discovered clades much more easily than they can under the rank-based codes. For many
                    researchers, naming clades is just as important as naming species. In this respect, the
                    <cite>PhyloCode</cite> reflects a philosophical shift from naming species and subsequently
                    classifying them (i.e., into higher taxa) to naming both species and clades. This does not mean,
                    however, that
                    all clades must be named. The decision to name a clade (or to link an existing name to it by
                    publishing a phylogenetic definition) may be based on diverse criteria, including (but not
                    restricted to), level of support, phenotypic distinctiveness, economic importance, and whether the
                    clade has historically been named.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another benefit of phylogenetic nomenclature is that it permits (though it does not require) the
                    abandonment of categorical ranks, which would eliminate the most subjective aspect of traditional
                    taxonomy. The arbitrary nature of ranking, though acknowledged by most taxonomists, is not widely
                    appreciated by non-taxonomists. The existence of ranks encourages researchers to use taxonomies
                    inappropriately, treating taxa at the same rank as though they were comparable in some biologically
                    meaningful way—for example, when they count genera or families to study past and present patterns of
                    biological diversity. A rankless system of taxonomy, which is permitted but not required by the
                    <cite>PhyloCode</cite>, encourages the development of more appropriate uses of taxonomies in such
                    studies, such as counting clades or species that possess properties relevant to the question of
                    interest, or investigating the evolution of those properties on a phylogenetic tree.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An advantage of the <cite>PhyloCode</cite> over the rank-based codes is that it applies at all
                    levels of
                    the taxonomic hierarchy. In contrast, the zoological code does not extend its rank-based method of
                    definition above the level of superfamily, and the botanical code extends that method of definition
                    only to some names above the rank of family (automatically typified names) and the principle of
                    priority is not mandatory for those names. Consequently, at higher levels in the hierarchy, the
                    rank-based codes permit multiple names for the same taxon as well as alternative applications of the
                    same name. Thus, as phylogenetic studies continue to reveal many deep clades, there is an increasing
                    potential for nomenclatural chaos due to synonymy and homonymy. By imposing rules of precedence on
                    clade names at all levels of the hierarchy, the <cite>PhyloCode</cite> will improve nomenclatural
                    clarity at higher hierarchical levels.

                    foreshadowed by earlier
                    suggestions that a taxon name could be defined by reference to a part of a phylogenetic tree (e.g.,

                    Three early symposia increased awareness of phylogenetic nomenclature. The first one, organized by
                    Richard G. Olmstead and entitled “Translating Phylogenetic Analyses into Classifications,” took
                    place at the 1995 annual meeting of the American Institute of Biological Sciences in San Diego,
                    California, USA. The 1996 Southwestern Botanical Systematics Symposium at the Rancho Santa Ana
                    Botanic Garden in Claremont, California, <abbr title="United States of America">USA</abbr>,
                    organized by J. Mark Porter and entitled “The
                    Linnean Hierarchy: Past, Present and Future,” focused in part on phylogenetic nomenclature. Philip
                    Cantino and Torsten Eriksson organized a symposium at the XVI International Botanical Congress in
                    St. Louis, Missouri, <abbr title="United States of America">USA</abbr> (1999), entitled “Overview
                    and Practical Implications of Phylogenetic

                    were also published during this period, but the debate became much more active after the posting of
                    the first version of the <cite>PhyloCode</cite> (see below).

                <p>
                    The preparation of the <cite>PhyloCode</cite> began in the autumn of 1997, following a decision by
                    Michael Donoghue, Philip Cantino, and Kevin de Queiroz to organize a workshop for this purpose. The
                    workshop took place August 7–9, 1998 at the Harvard University Herbaria, Cambridge, Massachusetts,
                    USA, and was attended by 27 people from five countries: William S. Alverson, Harold N. Bryant, David
                    C. Cannatella, Philip D. Cantino, Julia Clarke, Peter R. Crane, Noel Cross, Kevin de Queiroz,
                    Michael J. Donoghue, Torsten Eriksson, Jacques Gauthier, Kancheepuram Gandhi, Kenneth Halanych,
                    David S. Hibbett, David M. Hillis, Kathleen A. Kron, Michael S. Y. Lee, Alessandro Minelli, Richard
                    G. Olmstead, Fredrik Pleijel, J. Mark Porter, Heidi E. Robeck, Timothy Rowe, Christoffer Schander,
                    Per Sundberg, Mikael Thollesson, and André R. Wyss. An initial draft of the code prepared by Cantino
                    and de Queiroz was provided to the workshop participants in advance and was considerably revised by
                    Cantino and de Queiroz as a result of decisions made at the meeting. The initial draft of <a
                        href="/code/articles/22/">Article 22
                        (Governance)</a> was written by F. Pleijel, A. Minelli, and K. Kron and subsequently modified by
                    M.
                    Donoghue and P. Cantino. The initial draft of what is now <a
                        href="/code/articles/11#recommendation-11.10b">Recommendation 11.10B</a>
                    was contributed by T. Rowe. An earlier draft of what is now <a
                        href="/code/articles/10#article-10.10">Article 10.10</a>
                    was written by Gerry Moore, who also provided

                        href="/code/articles/8/">Article 8</a>
                    and
                    <a href="/code/appendices/a/">Appendix A</a> (both of which concern registration) were written
                    largely by T.
                    Eriksson. William M. Owens provided the Latin terms in <a

                    Whenever possible, the writers of the
                    <cite>PhyloCode</cite> used as a model the draft <cite>BioCode</cite> (<a

                    attempted to
                    unify the rank-based approach into a single code. Thus, the organization of the
                    <cite>PhyloCode</cite>,
                    some of its terminology, and the wording of certain rules are derived from the <cite>BioCode</cite>.
                    Other rules are derived from one or more of the rank-based codes, particularly the versions of the
                    botanical and zoological codes that were in effect at that time (<em class="author">Greuter</em> et
                    al., <a href="/code/preface/literature-cited#citation-greuter-et-al-1994">1994</a>,

                        href="/code/preface/literature-cited#citation-iczn-1999">1999</a>). However, many rules in the
                    <cite>PhyloCode</cite>
                    have no counterpart in any code based on taxonomic ranks because of fundamental differences in the
                    definitional foundations of the alternative systems.

                    The first public draft of the <cite>PhyloCode</cite> was posted on the Internet in April 2000. Its
                    existence was broadly publicized in the systematic biology community, and readers were encouraged to
                    submit comments and suggestions. All comments received were forwarded to the advisory group via a
                    listserver, and many of them elicited discussion. Numerous commentaries about phylogenetic
                    nomenclature have been published since the first public posting of the <cite>PhyloCode</cite>, some

                    A second workshop on phylogenetic nomenclature was held at Yale University, July 28–30, 2002,
                    organized by Michael Donoghue, Jacques Gauthier, Philip Cantino, and Kevin de Queiroz. There were 20
                    attendees from five countries, four of whom were observers. The active (voting) participants were
                    Christopher Brochu, Harold Bryant, Philip Cantino, Kevin de Queiroz, Michael Donoghue, Torsten
                    Eriksson, Jacques Gauthier, David Hibbett, Michel Laurin, Brent Mishler, Gerry Moore, Fredrik
                    Pleijel, J. Mark Porter, Greg Rouse, Christoffer Schander, and Mikael Thollesson. Sixteen proposed
                    changes in the rules and recommendations were discussed, 11 of which were approved. (Many other
                    minor wording changes had already been circulated by e-mail and approved in advance of the
                    workshop.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to specific rule changes, the 2002 workshop focused on several larger issues, the most
                    fundamental of which concerned the governance of species names. The first public draft of the
                    <cite>PhyloCode</cite> covered only clade names. Among the advisory group members, there was a
                    diversity
                    of opinions on how species names should be handled, ranging from those who thought that species
                    names should never be governed by the <cite>PhyloCode</cite> to those who argued that their
                    inclusion is
                    so essential that the <cite>PhyloCode</cite> should not be implemented until rules governing species
                    names have been added. The majority held the intermediate view that species names should eventually
                    be included in the
                    <cite>PhyloCode</cite> but that the controversy surrounding species and species names, both within
                    the
                    advisory group and in the systematics community as a whole, should not be allowed to delay
                    implementation of the rules for clade names. Thus, it was decided, first, that rules for clade names
                    and rules for species names would be published in separate documents and, second, that the timing of
                    implementation of the two documents would be independent; thus, the rules for clade names would
                    likely be implemented before those for species names. (This decision was reconsidered in 2006, and a
                    different approach to species names was adopted by the <abbr
                        title="Committee on Phylogenetic Nomenclature">CPN</abbr> in 2007; see below.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    A second major decision at the 2002 Yale workshop concerned the proposal of a companion volume, to
                    be published simultaneously with the <cite>PhyloCode</cite>, that would define various clade names
                    following the rules of the <cite>PhyloCode</cite> and serve as its starting point with regard to
                    priority. (This companion volume was later named <cite>Phylonyms: A Companion to the
                        PhyloCode</cite>.)
                    As originally conceived, the companion volume would have included phylogenetic definitions of the
                    most widely known names in most major groups of organisms. It was soon realized that several volumes
                    would be needed, that producing these volumes would be an immense job, and that linking the starting
                    date of the <cite>PhyloCode</cite> to their publication would greatly delay its implementation. For
                    this
                    reason, the participants in the second workshop decided to reduce the scope of the companion volume.
                    Instead of attempting a comprehensive treatment of widely known clade names for all major groups of
                    organisms, the companion volume would include only examples involving taxa for which there were
                    systematists who could be recruited to contribute entries. A plan for a conference was conceived in
                    which participants would apply phylogenetic nomenclature to clades that they study. The definitions
                    from the papers presented at the conference would form the nucleus of the companion volume. Michel
                    Laurin offered to organize the meeting, and Kevin de Queiroz and Jacques Gauthier were chosen to
                    edit the companion volume (Philip Cantino was enlisted in 2004 as a third editor).

                    The First International Phylogenetic Nomenclature Meeting took place July 6–9, 2004, at the Muséum
                    National d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris, organized by a 10-member committee chaired by Michel Laurin.
                    The meeting was described in detail by <em class="author">Laurin</em> and <em
                        class="author">Cantino</em> (2004), and the program and abstracts are

                        href="//phylonames.org">www.phylonames.org</a>. Unlike the preceding workshops, this
                    conference included research presentations and was open to anyone interested in attending. It was
                    attended by 70 people from 11 countries, and 36 papers were presented. The Paris conference also
                    served as the inaugural meeting of the International Society for Phylogenetic Nomenclature (<abbr
                        title="International Society for Phylogenetic Nomenclature">ISPN</abbr>),
                    including the election of a governing council and officers and approval of the bylaws (available at
                    the subsequently established <abbr

                    Presentations were given at the Paris meeting on the theory and practice of phylogenetic
                    nomenclature and its applications to a wide variety of groups. Besides the inauguration of the <abbr
                        title="International Society for Phylogenetic Nomenclature">ISPN</abbr>,
                    there were several other important outcomes of the meeting: (1) A proposal by K. de Queiroz and J.
                    Gauthier to adopt “an integrated system of phylogenetically defined names,” including the
                    application of widely known names to crown clades and forming the names of the corresponding total
                    clades by adding the prefix “<em class="affix">Pan-</em>” to the name of the crown (<em
                        class="author">Lauterbach</em>,
                    1989; <em class="author">Meier</em> and
                    <em class="author">Richter</em>,
                    1992; <em class="author">Gauthier</em> and <em class="author">de Queiroz</em>, 2001; <em
                        class="author">Joyce</em> et al.,
                    2004), was introduced and vigorously discussed.
                    Some participants were reluctant to make these conventions mandatory because doing so would result
                    in replacing some names that had already been explicitly defined as the names of total clades (e.g.,
                    replacing <em class="nomen">Synapsida</em> by <em class="nomen">Pan-Mammalia</em>). A compromise
                    that made exceptions for such
                    names was
                    acceptable to the majority of the participants, and it served as the basis for the set of rules and
                    recommendations that was eventually adopted by the <abbr
                        title="Committee on Phylogenetic Nomenclature">CPN</abbr> (<a
                        href="/code/articles/10#recommendation-10.1b">Recommendation 10.1B</a> and Articles
                    <a href="/code/articles/10#article-10.3">10.3</a>–<a href="/code/articles/10#article-10.8">10.8</a>
                    in version 3 of the <cite>PhyloCode</cite>, and after some subsequent modifications, <a
                        href="/code/articles/10#recommendation-10.1b">Recommendation
                        10.1B</a> and Articles <a href="/code/articles/10#article-10.3">10.3</a>–<a
                        href="/code/articles/10#article-10.7">10.7</a> in the current version). (2) Benoît Dayrat
                    proposed that
                    phylogenetically defined species names consist of a single word (the second part of the binomen in
                    the case of already existing names) plus the author of the name, year of publication, and (if
                    necessary to ensure uniqueness) the page number where published (Dayrat et al., 2004). In practice,
                    the name of a small clade (generally corresponding to a genus under the rank-based system) would
                    likely be cited before the species name, but it would not be part of the species name. In
                    conversation and in teaching, the name would likely be abbreviated to the single word (i.e.,
                    omitting the author and year) when doing so is unambiguous. Dayrat’s proposal was well received by
                    conference participants. (3) Julia Clarke proposed a flexible way of defining species names that is
                    applicable to the wide variety of entities that are called species. The definitions would take the
                    form “the species that includes specimen X” (de Queiroz, 1992), and the author would be required to
                    explain what he/she means by “species.” This approach is similar to the way species names are
                    implicitly defined in rank-based nomenclature but differs in that the species category is not a
                    rank, and the author is required to explain the kind of entity to which the name refers. (4) In a
                    straw vote of meeting participants, it was decided that Clarke, Dayrat, Cantino, and de Queiroz
                    would draft a code for species names based on the above-described proposals of Clarke and Dayrat.
                    Consistent with the decision made at the 2002 Yale workshop, this code would be separate from, but
                    compatible with, the code for clade names.

                    In the fall of 2004, Cantino and de Queiroz drafted a code for species names based on the proposals
                    approved at the Paris meeting. After review of the draft by Dayrat and Clarke and e-mail discussion
                    of unresolved issues, the four potential authors of the code met at the Smithsonian Institution on
                    May 20–21, 2006. In the process of drafting the code, the seriousness of the drawbacks of extending
                    the <cite>PhyloCode</cite> to species names using an epithet-based format had become more apparent.
                    Most
                    critically, species names would be different under rank-based and phylogenetic nomenclature (e.g.,
                    “<em class="nomen">Homo sapiens</em>” vs. “<em class="nomen">sapiens</em> <em
                        class="author">Linnaeus</em> 1758”), which
                    would create confusion. Second,
                    differences in the way types are handled under the zoological and botanical codes would complicate
                    the development of a universal code governing species names. Third, establishing and registering
                    reformatted names for every species known to science would be an immense job—and one of questionable
                    value given that there would be no fundamental difference in the way that the names would be
                    defined. What emerged from the May 2006 meeting was an entirely different (and much simpler) way to
                    reconcile the incompatibilities between traditional binominal species names and phylogenetic
                    nomenclature—including the mandatory genus category and the fact that many genera are not
                    monophyletic. This approach was subsequently adopted by the <abbr
                        title="Committee on Phylogenetic Nomenclature">CPN</abbr> (May, 2007), described in detail by
                    <em class="author">Dayrat</em> et al. (2008), and incorporated into the code (as <a
                        href="/code/articles/21/">Article
                        21</a>).
                </p>
                <p>

                    The Second Meeting of the <abbr
                        title="International Society for Phylogenetic Nomenclature">ISPN</abbr> took place June 28–July
                    2, 2006, at the Peabody Museum of Yale University, organized by an eight-member committee co-chaired
                    by Nico Cellinese and Walter Joyce.
                    Most of the papers were presented in three symposia: phylogenetic nomenclature of species (organized
                    by David Baum and Benoît Dayrat), implementing phylogenetic nomenclature (organized by Philip
                    Cantino), and phyloinformatics (organized by Michael Donoghue and Nico Cellinese). The meeting was
                    described in detail by <em class="author">Laurin</em> and <em class="author">Cantino</em> (2006,
                    2007), and the program and abstracts are available
                    at <a href="/documents">www.phylocode.org</a> and <a href="//phylonames.org">www.phylonames.org</a>.
                    At this second <abbr title="International Society for Phylogenetic Nomenclature">ISPN</abbr>
                    meeting, more time was
                    devoted to
                    open-ended discussions of issues raised in the presentations. The new approach to species names that
                    was developed at the May 2006 meeting in Washington (see previous paragraph) was presented in talks
                    by Clarke and Dayrat and was well received in the subsequent discussion. They and their coauthors
                    (Cantino and de Queiroz) were encouraged to continue work on a set of rules and recommendations that
                    would implement this approach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another issue that generated a lot of discussion at the second <abbr
                        title="International Society for Phylogenetic Nomenclature">ISPN</abbr> meeting was the
                    integrated
                    system of crown- and total-clade names that was introduced at the 2004 Paris meeting and
                    incorporated into <cite>PhyloCode</cite> version 3. Although the rules and recommendations promoting
                    an
                    integrated system in version 3 represented a compromise, there was still a lot of dissatisfaction on
                    the part of some discussants. An alternative means of referring to total clades using “pan” as a
                    function name was proposed by T. Michael Keesey. In the course of the discussion, it was suggested
                    that the prefix “pan-” (lower case) be used to designate informal names for total clades that may or
                    may not have a formal name. Because informal names do not compete with formal names for precedence,
                    they can coexist without violating Principle 3 (that each taxon may have only one accepted name).
                    Using this approach, a widely used name could be retained for a total clade and coexist with an
                    informal name with the prefix “pan-”. For example, the total clade of mammals might have the formal
                    name <em class="nomen">Synapsida</em> and the informal name pan-Mammalia. This suggestion led to
                    changes in <a href="/code/articles/10/">Article 10</a> that
                    were approved by the <abbr title="Committee on Phylogenetic Nomenclature">CPN</abbr> in January 2007
                    and included in this version of the code.
                </p>

                    The Third Meeting of the <abbr
                        title="International Society for Phylogenetic Nomenclature">ISPN</abbr> took place July 20–22,
                    2008, at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova
                    Scotia, organized by a four-member committee chaired by Harold Bryant. It was coordinated with a
                    joint meeting of the International Society of Protistologists and the International Society for
                    Evolutionary Protistology. In addition to contributed papers (see Laurin and Bryant, 2009, for
                    details), including a plenary talk by Sina Adl focusing on issues in protist nomenclature, the
                    meeting focused on how to expedite completion of two critical projects that must reach fruition
                    before implementation of the code: preparation of the companion volume (<cite>Phylonyms</cite>), to
                    be
                    published
                    simultaneously with the code, and development of the registration database (RegNum).
                </p>
                <p>

                    Because registration is required for establishment of names under the <cite>PhyloCode</cite>, the
                    registration database (which has come to be known as RegNum) had to be developed before the code
                    could be implemented. Torsten Eriksson and Mikael Thollesson initially designed the database
                    structure and reported on it at the 2002 Yale workshop. Further development of the database and
                    web/user interface was subsequently carried out at Uppsala University by Jonas Ekstedt and M.
                    Thollesson. An alpha test site for this version was announced at the 2004 Paris meeting. A prototype
                    of RegNum was demonstrated at a meeting of the <abbr
                        title="International Society for Phylogenetic Nomenclature">ISPN</abbr> Registration Committee
                    (Mikael Thollesson,
                    Torsten Eriksson, and Nico Cellinese) and other interested persons at Yale University on November
                    2–3, 2005, and it was subsequently demonstrated at both the 2006 and 2008 <abbr
                        title="International Society for Phylogenetic Nomenclature">ISPN</abbr> meetings. In 2009,
                    Nico Cellinese (University of Florida), who was chair of the Registration Committee at the time of
                    this writing, started the development of a more comprehensive and flexible prototype. The new
                    version of RegNum was conceived in line with other developments concerning biological name
                    repositories and resolution services (e.g., Global Name Architecture). RegNum’s prototype was
                    demonstrated at the 2009 Biodiversity Information Standards (<abbr
                        title="Taxonomic Databases Working Group">TDWG</abbr>)
                    meeting in Montpellier, France, during a workshop that focused on phylogenetic nomenclature and
                    future informatics development. The
                    RegNum database currently satisfies the requirements of the <cite>PhyloCode</cite>, and plans are in
                    place to integrate it with several tools and data repositories (e.g., <a
                        href="//treebase.org">TreeBASE</a>) that will enhance
                    its relevance for phylogenetic research.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In October 2011, the <abbr title="Committee on Phylogenetic Nomenclature">CPN</abbr> received a
                    proposal by Nico Cellinese, David Baum and Brent Mishler
                    concerning the treatment of species in this code, the justification for which was published by
                    Cellinese et al. (2012). Their fundamental premise was that the code is too strongly tied to a
                    particular view on the nature of species, which is not accepted by everyone who would like to use
                    phylogenetic nomenclature, and their proposed solution was to eliminate all mention of species in
                    the code. The proposal was publicized on the <abbr
                        title="International Society for Phylogenetic Nomenclature">ISPN</abbr> website and stimulated
                    more than a year of
                    intermittent discussion on the <abbr title="Committee on Phylogenetic Nomenclature">CPN</abbr>
                    listserv. In the end, the <abbr title="Committee on Phylogenetic Nomenclature">CPN</abbr> accepted
                    the underlying premise of
                    the proposal but rejected the proposed solution, which would have entailed radical changes in the
                    code, including: eliminating the use of species as specifiers (thus only specimens would be
                    specifiers); permitting the establishment of preexisting specific epithets as clade names;
                    redefining the term “homonym” such that established clade names may be identical provided that the
                    authors and publication years differ; and elimination of <a href="/code/articles/21/">Article
                        21</a>,
                    which provides recommendations
                    on how to use species names governed by the rank-based codes in conjunction with clade names
                    governed by this code. Instead of eliminating all reference to species, the definition of “species”
                    was broadened to accommodate the view that the species category is simply a rank in the Linnaean
                    hierarchy, while continuing to accommodate the view that it is a kind of biological entity. In
                    addition, the <abbr title="Committee on Phylogenetic Nomenclature">CPN</abbr> discussion of the
                    Cellinese et al. proposal led to other changes not proposed by
                    those authors, especially changes in <a href="/code/articles/11/">Article 11</a> related to using
                    species versus type specimens as
                    specifiers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An important change approved by the <abbr title="Committee on Phylogenetic Nomenclature">CPN</abbr>
                    in August 2013 was the expansion of the treatment of
                    phylogenetic definitions, which in many ways are the heart of this code. What were formerly a long
                    and complicated note (9.3.1) and three related recommendations (9.3B, 9D, and 9E) were expanded into
                    six articles (<a href="/code/articles/9#article-9.4">9.4</a>–<a
                        href="/code/articles/9#article-9.7">9.7</a> and <a
                        href="/code/articles/9#article-9.9">9.9</a>–<a href="/code/articles/9#article-9.10">9.10</a>).
                    Following a proposal by <em class="author">de Queiroz</em> (2013) that was motivated by
                    a distinction emphasized by <em class="author">Martin</em> et al. (2010), node-based and
                    branch-based definitions were
                    replaced with minimum-clade and maximum-clade definitions, respectively, throughout the code. The
                    primary reason for this change was to employ definitions that are applicable in the context of both
                    common interpretations of phylogenetic trees—one in which branches represent lineages and nodes
                    represent ancestors at lineage-splitting events; the other in which branches represent relationships
                    and nodes represent taxa (the term “branch-based” is inappropriate in the latter context, in which
                    all phylogenetic definitions are effectively node-based).
                </p>
                <p>

                    Another important change in <a href="/code/articles/9/">Article 9</a> is the explicit recognition of
                    definition categories for the
                    names of crown clades (<a href="/code/articles/9#article-9.9">Article 9.9</a>) and total clades (<a
                        href="/code/articles/9#article-9.10">Article 9.10</a>), the variants of which (e.g.,
                    the maximum-crown-clade definition, which is roughly equivalent to what were previously called
                    branch-modified node-based definition) are presented more systematically and thoroughly than in
                    previous versions of the code. Additionally, a new note (<a
                        href="/code/articles/9#note-9.5.1">9.5.1</a>) was added describing a kind of
                    minimum-clade definition that had no analog in previous versions of this code, the
                    directly-specified-ancestor definition, weherein the ancestor in which the clade originated is
                    identified by name rather than being specified indirectly through its descendants, and <a
                        href="/code/articles/9#note-9.9.2">Note 9.9.2</a>
                    was added to describe its use for defining the names of crown clades.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Readers interested in more information about the sequence of changes from one version of this code
                    to the next are referred to <a href="/documents">www.phylocode.org</a>, where all previous versions
                    are available. The
                    changes implemented in versions 3 and 4 are summarized in the preface of each, and changes
                    implemented in version 5 are summarized in a separate document.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is only one major modification in the current version of the code (version 6) relative to
                    version 5. The rules on publication (Articles <a href="/code/articles/4/">4</a> and <a
                        href="/code/articles/5/">5</a>) have been revised to permit electronic
                    publication, based on modifications proposed by Nico Cellinese and Richard Olmstead. Most other
                    changes from version 5 are simply clarifications, but two new rules (Articles <a
                        href="/code/articles/10#article-10.7">10.7</a> and <a
                        href="/code/articles/14#article-14.5">14.5</a>) have
                    been added to ensure that accepted panclade names are always based on the names of the corresponding
                    crown clades.
