                        <h5>1.1</h5>. The groups of organisms or species considered potential recipients of scientific
                        names are called taxa (singular: taxon). The only taxa whose names are governed by this code are
                        clades. However, species, whose names are governed by the rank-based codes, are frequently used
                        to define clade names in this code.

                        <h5>2.1</h5>. In this code, a clade is an ancestor (an organism, population, or species) and all
                        of its descendants.

                            <h6>Note 2.1.1</h6>. Every individual organism (on Earth) belongs to at least one clade
                            (i.e., the clade comprising all extant and extinct organisms, assuming that they share a
                            single origin). Each organism also belongs to a number of nested clades (though the ancestor
                            of the clade comprising all life—again assuming a single origin—does not belong to any other
                            clade).

                            <h6>Note 2.1.3</h6>. Clades are often either nested or mutually exclusive; however,
                            phenomena such as speciation via hybridization, species fusion, and symbiogenesis can result
                            in clades that are partially overlapping (<a href="#fig-1">Fig. 1</a>).

                                    Speciation via hybridization (a) and species fusion (b) can result in clades that are partially overlapping.
                                    In (a), the origin of species X via hybridization (represented by the dashed line) between members of species B and C results in partial overlap between the largest clade containing A but not D (or the smallest clade containing both A and B), which is composed of A, B, and X, and the largest clade containing D but not A (or the smallest clade containing C and D), which is composed of C, D, and X, in that X is part of both clades.  In (b), fusion of species G and H to form species Y (with the two parent species disappearing in the process) results in partial overlap between the largest clade containing E but not J (or the smallest clade containing both E and G), which is composed of E, F, G, and Y, and the largest clade containing J but not E (or the smallest clade containing both H and J), which is composed of H, I, J, and Y, in that Y is part of both clades.
