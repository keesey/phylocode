            <h2>Division I. Principles</h2>
            <section id="principles-1">
                1. Reference. The primary purpose of taxon names is to provide a means of referring to taxa, as opposed
                to indicating their characters, relationships, or membership.
            </section>
            <section id="principles-2">
                2. Clarity. Taxon names should be unambiguous in their designation of particular taxa. Nomenclatural
                clarity is achieved through explicit definitions that describe the concept of the taxon designated by
                the defined name.
            </section>
            <section id="principles-3">
                3. Uniqueness. To promote clarity, each taxon should have only one accepted name, and each accepted name
                should refer to only one taxon.
            </section>
            <section id="principles-4">
                4. Stability. The names of taxa should not change over time. As a corollary, it must be possible to name
                newly discovered taxa without changing the names of previously discovered taxa.
            </section>
            <section id="principles-5">
                5. Phylogenetic context. This code is concerned with the naming and subsequent application of the names
                of phylogenetically conceptualized taxa.
            </section>
            <section id="principles-6">
                6. Taxonomic freedom. This code does not restrict freedom of opinion with regard to hypotheses about
                relationships; it only concerns how names are to be applied within the context of any relevant
                phylogenetic hypothesis.
            </section>
            <section id="principles-7">
                7. There is no “case law” under this code. Nomenclatural problems are resolved by the Committee on
                Phylogenetic Nomenclature (<abbr title="Committee on Phylogenetic Nomenclature">CPN</abbr>) by direct
                application of the code; previous decisions will be
                considered, but the <abbr title="Committee on Phylogenetic Nomenclature">CPN</abbr> is not obligated by
                precedents set in those decisions.
