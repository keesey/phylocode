                    The name of a species under the rank-based codes (except the <cite><abbr
                            title="International Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature">ICVCN</abbr></cite>) is
                    a binomen (two-part name), the first part of which is a generic name (i.e., a name that is tied to
                    the rank of genus) and the second part of which is a specific name (<cite><abbr
                            title="International Code of Zoological Nomenclature">ICZN</abbr></cite>) or epithet
                    (<cite><abbr title="International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes">ICNP</abbr></cite>,
                    <cite><abbr
                            title="International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi, and Plants">ICNAFP</abbr></cite>)
                    (i.e., a name that is tied to the rank of species). Because this code is independent of categorical
                    ranks (<a href="/code/chapters/1#article-3.1">Art. 3.1</a>), the first part of a species binomen is
                    not interpreted as a genus name but simply as the name of a taxon that includes that species.

                        When establishing a new species name (binomen) under the appropriate rank-based code, some
                        mechanism should be used to indicate whether the genus name is an established clade name under
                        this code. If symbols are used, their meaning should be made clear.

                            Although <a href="#recommendation-21.3a-example-1">Example 1</a> uses one symbol to indicate
                            establishment under this code and another symbol to indicate the absence of such
                            establishment, an alternative would be to use the presence or absence of a single symbol.
                            However, using absence of a symbol to designate nomenclatural status is potentially
                            confusing because its absence may result from accidental omission. Furthermore, some readers
                            may misinterpret absence of a symbol because they are unaware of the author’s convention.

                            If a symbol (e.g., quotation marks) is used to indicate non-monophyly of the taxon
                            designated by the genus name, it would be redundant to indicate that the genus name is not

                    <p>
                        When publishing the name of a new species, selection of a genus name will require consideration
                        of the nomenclatural consequences under both the appropriate rank-based code and this code. In
                        general, a genus name that is also an established clade name (or is simultaneously being
                        established as a clade name) under this code should be selected if possible. (If the names of
                        more than one clade in a nested series of clades satisfy these conditions, any one of the names
                        may be selected.) If this is not possible, an existing genus name may be used, even if the
                        monophyly of the associated taxon under the rank-based code is unknown or doubtful, or a new
                        genus name may be used. If the species to be named cannot be assigned to any taxon with which a
                        genus name has been associated under the appropriate rank-based code, then the only option is to
                        publish a new name to serve as a generic name under the appropriate rank-based code. This name
                        may be simultaneously established as a clade name under this code.

                        When a species uninomen is combined with a clade name that is not also a genus name, the
                        uninomen can be viewed as a name in its own right, rather than as a modifier (adjectival or
                        possessive) of the clade name. Consequently, the ending of the uninomen should not be changed to
                        agree in gender or number (plural vs. singular) with the name with which it is combined. When a
                        species uninomen is combined with a genus name, its gender may be changed to agree with that of
                        the genus name.
