                    Conservation of names and emendation of definitions are means of overriding precedence based on
                    date of establishment (<a href="/code/articles/12/#article-12.2">Art. 12.2</a>) in the interest
                    of stability (e.g., in terms of composition and/or diagnostic characters).

                <p>
                    Conservation of names is possible only under extraordinary circumstances and requires approval
                    of the Committee on Phylogenetic Nomenclature (<abbr

                    Once a name has been conserved, the entry for the affected name in the registration database is
                    to be annotated to indicate its conserved status relative to other names that are simultaneously
                    suppressed. The entries for suppressed names are to be similarly annotated.

                    In the case of heterodefinitional synonyms, the earlier name may be conditionally suppressed so
                    that it may be used when not considered synonymous with the later name. In the case of homonyms
                    and homodefinitional synonyms, suppression is unconditional.

                    When a name is unconditionally suppressed, there are no conditions under which it has precedence
                    with regard to either synonymy or homonymy. Therefore, if a homodefinitional synonym has been
                    suppressed, that name can be established subsequently with a different definition as an
                    acceptable name.

                            Several recent phylogenetic analyses suggest that <em class="nomen">Amborella
                                trichopoda</em> is sister to the rest of <em class="nomen">Angiospermae</em>, but
                            evidence for this position of <em class="nomen">Amborella</em> was not discovered until
                            the late 1990s. If, prior to this discovery, <em class="nomen">Angiospermae</em> had
                            been given a minimum-crown-clade definition that did not include <em class="nomen">Amborella
                                trichopoda</em> as an internal specifier, <em class="nomen">Angiospermae</em> would not
                            include <em class="nomen">Amborella</em>
                            according to its currently inferred relationships. However, the definitional author
                            would presumably have intended for <em class="nomen">Amborella</em> to be included in
                            <em class="nomen">Angiospermae</em> because it has always been included in the taxon
                            designated by that name. In such a situation, an unrestricted emendation that adds <em
                                class="nomen">Amborella trichopoda</em> to the list of internal specifiers would
                            avoid an undesirable change in clade composition and would be consistent with the clade
                            conceptualization of the original definitional author and with historical use.

                        Suppose that the name <em class="nomen">Dinosauria</em> had first been defined
                        phylogenetically as the smallest clade containing <em class="nomen">Megalosaurus

                        and <em class="nomen">Iguanodon bernissartensis</em> <em class="author">Boulenger</em> in <em
                            class="author">Beneden</em> 1881 (<em class="nomen">Ornithischia</em>). Further, suppose
                        that the definitional author(s) had
                        considered <em class="nomen">Dinosauria</em> to include <em class="nomen">Herrerasauridae</em>.
                        If, under a newly proposed phylogenetic hypothesis,
                        <em class="nomen">Herrerasauridae</em> is no longer included in <em

                        fundamental to their use of the name <em class="nomen">Dinosauria</em>, conflicting evidence
                        exists concerning the original conceptualization of that taxon. Therefore, adding a species
                        of <em class="nomen">Herrerasauridae</em> to the set of internal specifiers in the
                        definition of <em class="nomen">Dinosauria</em>, or otherwise modifying the definition of
                        <em class="nomen">Dinosauria</em> so that it refers to a clade that includes <em
                            class="nomen">Herrerasauridae</em>, would require consideration by the <abbr

                    Although anyone may publish an unrestricted emendation, it is preferable that the emendation be
                    authored or coauthored by the author or authors of the original definition. If one or more of
                    the original definitional authors are still alive, another worker who thinks that an
                    unrestricted emendation is warranted must provide evidence when registering the emendation that
                    the first author of the original definition (or the second, third authors, etc., if the first
                    author is deceased or otherwise unable to respond) was contacted and offered the opportunity to
                    co-author the emendation.

                        Minimal evidence required for registration of an unrestricted emendation includes the e-mail
                        address or phone number of the original definitional author(s) contacted and the date when
                        the contact was made. If all of the original definitional authors are deceased or otherwise
                        unable to respond, this information must be submitted to the registration database as well.
                        Supplementary information such as the text of the definitional author(s)’ response may also
                        be submitted.

                        co-author an emendation of the original definition, it is not necessary that they be offered
                        the opportunity to co-author the entire publication in which the emendation appears (see <a

                    apply to the same clade, the original definition has precedence.
