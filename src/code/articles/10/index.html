                <p>
                    Clade names are generally to be selected in such a way as to minimize disruption of current
                    and/or historical usage (with regard to composition, diagnostic characters, or both) and to
                    maximize continuity with existing literature. Therefore, except under the conditions described
                    in <a href="#article-10.2">Article 10.2</a>, a preexisting name that has been applied to a taxon
                    approximating the clade to be named (see <a href="/code/articles/9#note-9.15.2">Note
                        9.15.2</a>), or to a paraphyletic group originating in the same ancestor, must be selected.
                    If there is a preexisting name for a paraphyletic group originating in the same ancestor as a
                    particular clade and that name is much better known than any preexisting name for that clade, or
                    if there is no preexisting name for that clade, the name of the paraphyletic group may be (but
                    need not be) chosen.

                    preexisting names to crown, apomorphy-based, or total clades. Because the associations of
                    preexisting names with precisely identified clades commonly are ambiguous, reasonable arguments
                    can often be made for applying a particular name to any one of several nested clades between
                    crown and total (inclusive).

                        If more than one preexisting name has been applied to a particular clade (including those
                        applied to paraphyletic groups originating in the same ancestor), the name that is most
                        widely and consistently used for it should generally be chosen, though a less widely used
                        name may be chosen if it is a panclade name (see <a href="#article-10.3">Art. 10.3</a> and
                        <a href="#note-10.3.1">Note 10.3.1</a>). Similarly, if a preexisting name has been applied
                        to more than one clade, it should generally be established for the clade to which it has
                        been most widely and consistently applied (but see <a hreg="#note-10.1.1">Note 10.1.1</a>).
                        If the most widely and consistently used name is not selected for conversion, a rationale
                        should be provided.

                            In selecting “the name that is most widely and consistently used,” considerable
                            discretion is left to the converting author. It is not necessary to choose a name that
                            is slightly more widely used than its closest competitor. As a general guideline, if
                            there is less than a twofold difference in the frequency of use of two or more names,
                            the converting author may choose any of them without providing a compelling
                            justification.

                            In older works and in works dealing only with extant organisms, names have sometimes
                            been
                            used as if they apply to particular crown clades, though it is unclear whether the
                            author
                            considered the name to apply to the crown or to a larger clade (i.e., including some or
                            all
                            of the stem). In such cases, the name may be interpreted as applying to the crown for
                            the
                            purpose of this recommendation.

                        Extinction of crown clades after establishment of a panclade name does not affect the
                        composition of the clade to which the panclade name refers. A crown clade that is extant at
                        the time of establishment of a panclade name is forever treated nomenclaturally as though it
                        were still extant. This treatment applies both to the crown clade that provides the base
                        name for the panclade name and to other crown clades whose members are implicit external
                        specifiers (see <a href="#note-10.5.2">Note 10.5.2</a>).

                    In rank-based nomenclature, there are many examples of identically spelled names being applied
                    to different taxa under different codes (cross-code homonyms). Only one member of each set of
                    cross-code homonyms is, after conversion, an acceptable name under this code (<a
                        href="/code/articles/13#article-13.3">Art. 13.3</a>). If the preexisting name that has been
                    most widely used for a particular clade cannot be converted because an identically spelled name
                    has already been converted and established for a different clade, another preexisting name that
                    has been widely and recently applied to the clade concerned (or to a paraphyletic group
                    originating in the same ancestor) may be selected. On the other hand, continuity with existing
                    literature and consistency with rank-based nomenclature are not well served by resurrecting old
                    and little-known names. Therefore, if there is no other name that has been widely applied to the
                    clade in the recent past, a new name should be selected that consists of the most widely used
                    preexisting name with a taxon-related prefix added, such as <em class="affix">Phyto-</em> for
                    plants, <em class="affix">Phyco-</em> for “algae” excluding cyanobacteria, and <em

                    published earlier) should be the one that is converted under this code. For the other homonym,
                    the synonym (if one exists) that will likely be applied to this taxon under the rank-based code
                    should be converted, provided that this synonym qualifies as a preexisting name for the clade of

                <p>
                    When establishing a name for a crown clade that, under rank-based nomenclature, corresponds to a
                    monogeneric “higher” taxon, the genus name should be converted for that clade rather than any of
                    the suprageneric names that have been applied to it. Doing so will permit the use of the
                    “higher” taxon names for larger clades that extend beyond the crown.
                </p>
                <section id="recommendation-10g-example-1">
                    <h5>Example 1</h5>
                    <p>
                        In rank-based nomenclature, the names <em class="nomen">Equisetophyta</em>, <em
                            class="nomen">Equisetopsida</em>, <em class="nomen">Equisetales</em>, <em
                            class="nomen">Equisetaceae</em>, and <em class="nomen">Equisetum</em> have all been used
                        to refer to the same crown clade, which is widely understood to include only the genus <em
                            class="nomen">Equisetum</em>. (Most of these names have also been used to refer to more
                        inclusive clades that contain extinct species outside the crown.) When selecting a name to
                        convert for the crown clade, <em class="nomen">Equisetum</em> should be chosen. The names
                        <em class="nomen">Equisetaceae</em>, <em class="nomen">Equisetales</em>, etc. are better
                        applied to clades that are more inclusive than the crown.
