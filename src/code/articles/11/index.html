                    Specifiers are species, specimens, or apomorphies cited in a phylogenetic definition of a name
                    as reference points that serve to specify the clade to which the name applies. All specifiers
                    used in minimum-clade and maximum-clade definitions, and one of the specifiers used in
                    apomorphy-based definitions, are species or specimens. The other specifier used in an
                    apomorphy-based definition is an apomorphy.

                    <p>
                        Although subordinate clades cannot be specifiers, they may be cited in a phylogenetic
                        definition of the name of a more inclusive clade to clarify the phylogenetic position of a
                        specifier.

                    An internal specifier is a species, specimen, or apomorphy that is explicitly included in the
                    clade whose name is being defined; an external specifier is a species or specimen that is
                    explicitly excluded from it. All specifiers in minimum-clade (including minimum-crown-clade),
                    apomorphy-based, and apomorphy-modified crown-clade definitions are normally internal (though
                    external specifiers may be used to prevent use of a name under certain hypotheses of
                    relationships, clade composition, or both; see <a

                    (including maximum-crown-clade and maximum-total-clade) definitions always have at least one

                    Because species names are governed by the rank-based codes, they are generally associated with
                    type specimens, which serve as reference points for the names; this situation bears on the use
                    of species as specifiers under this code. In effect, whichever currently accepted species
                    includes the type specimen of the species name cited in the definition is the specifier. If the
                    species name originally cited in a definition is no longer accepted, then the species name with
                    which it has been synonymized becomes the name of the specifier species. However, should the
                    species name originally cited in the definition become the accepted name of a species at a later
                    time, that name would again become the name of the specifier species. The status of a species as
                    a specifier is unaffected by the designation of a new or different type under the appropriate
                    rank-based code. A species may be used as a specifier even if its name lacks a type. See also <a

                        There may be differences in taxonomic opinion as to whether a specimen can be referred to a

                        the establishment of a clade name by adopting a different species definition from that of
                        the definitional author and thereby challenging the claim that a particular specifier cannot
                        be referred to a named species. However, wholesale rejection of the species category cannot
                        be used as a basis for claiming that a particular specimen cannot be referred to any
                        species, and the use of non-types as specifiers based on such an argument constitutes
                        grounds for challenging the establishment of the name.

                    Definitions of converted clade names should be stated in a way that attempts to capture the
                    spirit of traditional use to the degree that it is consistent with the contemporary concept of
                    monophyly. Consequently, such a definition should not necessitate (though it may allow) the
                    inclusion of subtaxa that have traditionally been excluded from the taxon designated by the
                    preexisting name, as well as the exclusion of subtaxa that have traditionally been included in
                    the taxon. To accomplish this goal, internal specifiers of converted clade names should be
                    chosen from among the taxa that have been considered to form part of a taxon under traditional
                    ideas about the composition of that taxon, and they should not include members of subtaxa that
                    have traditionally been considered not to be part of the taxon.

                        The creation of new clade names that add such a prefix to a preexisting or converted name
                        with a rank-specific ending may lead to confusion for users of the rank-based system because
                        the new name may be incorrectly taken to imply the existence of a genus name with the same
                        prefix.

                    When defining the names of low-level clades that coincide with or overlap the boundaries of
                    species, differences in species criteria and hypothesized species boundaries may result in a
                    phylogenetically defined name being applied to different clades even in the context of the same
                    phylogeny. Recommendations <a href="#recommendation-11h">11H</a> and <a
                        href="#recommendation-11i">I</a> are intended to reduce the likelihood of this undesirable
                    outcome and address it when it occurs. If the definitional author is aware that using a
                    particular species as a specifier may result in the application of the name to a different clade
                    than if the type specimen of that species’ name were instead used, one or the other should be
                    unambiguously selected as the specifier (see Arts. <a href="#article-11.4">11.4</a> and <a
                        href="#article-11.6">11.6</a> for the ramifications of that choice), and the situation
                    should be clearly explained in the protologue.

                <p>
                    If, after establishment of a clade name, it is discovered that a species or type specimen used
                    as a specifier results in the name being applied to a different clade (in the context of the
                    same phylogeny) than if the other entity, i.e., the type specimen or species, had been used
                    instead, and if the ambiguity would be eliminated by selecting the other entity as the
                    specifier, then an unrestricted emendation (Arts. <a
                        href="/code/articles/15#article-15.11">15.11</a>–<a
                        href="/code/articles/15#article-15.13">15.13</a>) designating that entity as the specifier
                    may be published (see also <a href="#recommendation-11j">Rec. 11J</a>). It is preferable, though
                    not required, that the emendation be published by the original definitional author(s) (<a
                        href="/cod/articles/15#article-15.14">Art. 15.14</a>). If such an emendation is published by
                    anyone other than the original definitional author(s), the intent of the original author(s)
                    should be considered carefully and addressed in the protologue of the emendation (see <a
                        href="/code/articles/15#note-15.11.4">Note 15.11.4</a> and Arts. <a
                        href="/code/articles/15#article-15.12">15.12</a> and <a
                        href="/code/articles/15#article-15.13">15.13</a>). If the protologue of the original
                    definition included a discussion of the choice of species versus type specimens as specifiers
                    (see <a href="#recommendation-11h">Rec. 11H</a>), this should be viewed as part of the
                    author(s)’ intent. Specifically, if the author(s) stated that their preference for using type
                    specimens (or conversely, species) as specifiers regardless of the effect on clade composition,
                    that preference should be honored; in such a case, an unrestricted emendation by anyone other
                    than the author(s) would be inappropriate.

                    If an emendation is published in the situation described in <a
                        href="#recommendation-11i">Recommendation 11I</a>, and if a species originally used as a
                    specifier has more than one type (i.e., syntypes), whichever syntype is chosen as the new
                    specifier should be simultaneously designated as the lectotype of that species under the
                    appropriate rank-based code.
