                        clade name, requires a hypothesized phylogeny. To accommodate phenomena such as speciation
                        via hybridization, species fusion, and symbiogenesis (see <a
                            href="/code/chapters/1/#note-2.1.3">Note 2.1.3</a>), the hypothesized phylogeny that

                        strictly diverging.

                    A phylogenetic definition is a statement that explicitly identifies a particular clade as the
                    referent of a taxon name. Different categories of acceptable phylogenetic definitions include,
                    but are not limited to, those described in Articles <a href="#article-9.5">9.5</a>–<a
                        href="#article-9.7">9.7</a> and <a href="#article-9.9">9.9</a>–<a href="#article-9.10">9.10</a>.

                        Because poorly chosen wordings of phylogenetic definitions can lead to undesirable
                        consequences (i.e., the application of the name in a way that contradicts the author’s
                        intent), the wordings provided in Articles <a href="#article-9.5">9.5</a>–<a
                            href="#article-9.7">9.7</a> and <a href="#article-9.9">9.9</a>–<a
                            href="#article-9.10">9.10</a> should generally be used for the corresponding kinds of
                        definitions. If an alternative wording is used, it should be accompanied by the standard
                        abbreviation (as provided in Arts. <a href="#article-9.5">9.5</a>–<a
                            href="#article-9.7">9.7</a>, Arts. <a href="#article-9.9">9.9</a>–<a

                        intent of the author in case the alternative wording is ambiguous or confusing. If the
                        definition in words and its abbreviated form appear to be in conflict, the latter should be
                        weighted most heavily in interpreting the author’s intent. This recommendation does not
                        preclude the use of other kinds of definitions that are not addressed in Articles <a

                    internal specifiers (<a href="/code/articles/11/#article-11.2">Art. 11.2</a>). A minimum-clade
                    definition may be abbreviated “min ∇ (A & B)”. Additional internal specifiers (e.g., C & D & E,
                    etc.) may be used as needed (e.g., if the basal relationships within the clade are poorly
                    supported). For defining the names of crown clades using minimum-clade definitions, see <a

                        indirectly through its descendants. A directly-specified-ancestor definition may take the
                        form “the clade originating in A” or “the smallest clade containing A”, where A is an
                        internal specifier (<a href="/code/articles/11/#article-11.2">Art. 11.2</a>). A

                        It is important to use the appropriate operator, “and” (“&”) versus “or” (“⌵”), in
                        definitions employing multiple external specifiers (only the “and” operator would normally
                        be used in definitions employing multiple internal specifiers). The “and” operator is to be
                        used when the intent is to exclude jointly all of the external specifiers from the named
                        clade. For example, it would be appropriate to use “and” when using a maximum-clade
                        definition with multiple external specifiers to deal with uncertainty regarding the sister
                        group of the named clade—that is, to exclude jointly every taxon that is a potential sister
                        group. By contrast, the “or” operator is to be used when the intent is to exclude, whether
                        individually or jointly, any one (or more) of the external specifiers from the named clade.
                        For example, it would be appropriate to use “or” when using a minimum-clade definition with
                        multiple external specifiers, including those used in qualifying clauses, to render the
                        defined name inapplicable in the context of phylogenetic hypotheses in which any one (or
                        more) of the external specifiers is more closely related to some of the internal specifiers
                        than those internal specifiers are to other internal specifiers (see <a

                    An apomorphy-based definition associates a name with a clade originating in the first ancestor
                    to evolve a specified apomorphy that was inherited by one or more internal specifiers. Such a

                    inherited by A, originated” or “the clade for which M, as inherited by A, is an apomorphy” or

                    shared by those specifiers as the result of homoplasy). For defining the names of crown clades

                    It is permissible to establish a name with a crown-clade definition using an internal specifier
                    that is not extant on the publication date under the following conditions: If that internal
                    specifier is a species, either the specifier must have been extant as of 1500 CE or there must
                    be specimens of the specifier species in existence that were collected when that species was
                    extant. If that internal specifier is a specimen, the organism must either have died in or after
                    1500 CE or have been alive when it was collected. If an author of a definition intends to define
                    “extant” as anything other than extant on the publication date of the definition, the intended
                    meaning must be indicated explicitly or implicitly in the protologue.

                        Demonstrating “prior application of the name to a taxon approximating the clade for which it
                        is being established” does not necessarily require a modern phylogenetic analysis, and it
                        does not require that the author of the prior application conceptualized the taxon as a
                        clade. Application of a name in an earlier publication to a taxon approximating the clade
                        for which it is being converted can be demonstrated based on information in that work—e.g.,
                        a list of subordinate taxa that are broadly consistent with, though not necessarily
                        identical to, the composition of that clade, a description including diagnostic characters
                        that we now understand to be apomorphies of that clade, or statements and diagrams about
                        phylogenetic relationships. When composition is used to assess the prior application of a
                        name, the historical inclusion of taxa that are no longer considered to belong to the clade
                        in question, or the historical exclusion of taxa that are now considered to belong to this
                        clade, does not necessarily disqualify it as a preexisting name for the clade, provided that
                        its application to that clade approximates traditional use to the degree that it is
                        consistent with the contemporary concept of monophyly.

                            In order for two uses of identically spelled preexisting names to be considered the same
                            name rather than homonyms, one use must have been derived from the other or both derived
                            from a third use of the name. If later uses of a name are not accompanied by a reference
                            to an earlier use, absence of any overlap in the compositions associated with
                            identically spelled names can be taken as evidence that they are homonyms (<a
                                href="#note-9.15a.2-example-1">Ex. 1</a>). However, even if there is some overlap,
                            evidence in the protologues may still indicate that the names are homonyms (<a

                    In order to facilitate the referral of species and specimens that are not specifiers of the
                    clade name, as well as less inclusive clades, the protologue should include a description,
                    diagnosis, or list of apomorphies.

                    Although both sets of terms refer to the same definitional forms (wordings) described in
                    Articles <a href="#article-9.5">9.5</a>, <a href="#article-9.6">9.6</a>, and <a
                        href="#article-9.9">9.9</a>, the definitional concepts to which they refer are not
                    necessarily identical (and thus the terms are not strictly equivalent). For example, a
                    minimum-clade definition is not necessarily a node-based definition in that the most recent
                    common ancestor of A and B need not be interpreted as corresponding to a node representing a
                    lineage at the instant of a splitting event; it could instead be interpreted as corresponding to
                    a branch representing an entire ancestral species.
